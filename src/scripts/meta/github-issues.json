Using plain white masks as the template, we're asking attendees to deface their mask using Sharpie markers, creating a version of the identity they aim to portray online. Then, with permission, they will be filmed in 3D wearing the mask (a simple 360 headshot), the the aim to include both digital imagery (as immersive an VR experience of others' identities) and each mask in a physical art instillation/group exhibition.  \n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nHighlight to attendees and MozFest community the extent to which we reconstruct our reality online, provoking thought. Discuss whether this is a good thing. If we always portray how we want to be seen, and whether the relative anonymity of this, coupled with the pressures of social media, changes how we interact. instillation and group exhibition - highlights a sense of community, bringing together the best intentions of identity online, and identity through face-to-face interaction. I hope to create a fun and inclusive space for all to share their thoughts and get creative, a skill valued across all sectors, whilst provoking thoughts and questions about the pressures social media place upon an individual and their reactions to that.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nSharpie permanent markers in a variety of colours, a number of plain white masks with elastics for hanging, a space to hang the masks and a means to do so (I can however work this out on the day if necessary). Tables and chairs, 360 degree camera, HTC Vive/google cardboard.\n\n\n### Time needed\nAll weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session\n",

For Gandhi, western economics was a devastating negation of the spiritual identity of an Indian. Self-sufficiency was articulated as an attempt to wrest control from the dominant force of the time – the British empire. However, the spirit of self-sustenance went beyond the rejection of the foreign. Gandhi had a radical and nuanced view of what constituted the Indian nation, that many would now consider not only unviable but perhaps also dangerous. Gandhi insisted that the state empower villages to remain independent economic entities, with local production aligned with local consumption.\r\n\r\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\r\nUnderstanding of craft as a way of making change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Time needed\r\nAll weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session\r\n",

We founded this magazine because we saw a gap in the practice of slow, considered making and the breakneck speed of technology. We wanted to anthologize the sprawling online conversations and provide a place of re ection for people interested in crafting technology in more responsible ways. It is our place of refuge to discuss internet health and emerging technologies - slowly, sustainably and in print.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nToday we live with digital technology that’s primarily manufactured in Shenzhen and designed in Silicon Valley. Centralization of production means that there is less choice and less inclusion. We need decentralized ecosystems, where craft thrives so that people can deploy the materials around them to make local solutions that last a long time. We hope you enjoy this session and that it sparks ideas for crafting technology in healthier ways.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nN\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

State-sponsored surveillance, theft of personal information, trolls arrogantly abusing others—this has become normal. And every day, many of us trade personal information for convenience.\r\n\r\nIt’s time to flip the script. Not everyone knows how to install a VPN or use encryption—but everyone should feel safe online. Can we imagine a future where manufacturers respect our safety by default when they build products? Where governments take steps to protect us? Can we find fun, new ways to engage our friends and neighbours around these issues?\r\n\r\nAt Mozfest, we’ll build, teach and play with these new approaches to Privacy & Security. Let’s put safety first.\r\n",

This could involve using technologies such as web VR, AR or the internet of things to advocate for a healthier internet or mitigate against identified threats. The session would be an interactive workshop, initially diving into the key challenges identified in the Internet Health Report and then showcasing the best student responses.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe goal of the session is for the students and attendees to have a deeper understanding of how technologies hosted on the web can be harnessed to make the web itself healthier. Whilst new web technologies are exciting to play around with, this session aims to show that they can be harnessed to take society a step closer to having an internet that is more open and accessible for all.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nNone\n\n\n### Time needed\nless than 60 mins\n",

State-sponsored surveillance, theft of personal information, trolls arrogantly abusing others—this has become normal. And every day, many of us trade personal information for convenience.\r\n\r\nIt’s time to flip the script. Not everyone knows how to install a VPN or use encryption—but everyone should feel safe online. Can we imagine a future where manufacturers respect our safety by default when they build products? Where governments take steps to protect us? Can we find fun, new ways to engage our friends and neighbours around these issues?\r\n\r\nAt Mozfest, we’ll build, teach and play with these new approaches to Privacy & Security. Let’s put safety first.\r\n",

Set them a task to work in pairs/groups of three, to discuss the topic inclusion for all [how can we support everyone in society to have a voice even if they might struggle in day to day life with this]. Plan how they will present it through an accessible artform. They go and explore the space at Mozilla fest, gather any evidence/inspiration to then on to creating, this will take the longest. I would assist anyone that needs ideas or help. Final part is a group presentation back about their piece, explain why they have created this piece.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nIn the session, participants create pieces of artwork that publish online/put up artwork around different of spaces of Mozilla Fest to display. The artwork topic is [“How can we enable everyone to express their reasonable voice without fear of retaliation”]. Do we live in a world where inclusion is for all? I will give examples to suggest idea for the artwork, like drawings, poetry recording small soundbites, interviewing a person, collage, typography, stenciling.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nProjector, plain white paper, scissors, felt tip/coloured markers, water colours, oil pastels, glue sticks/pva glue, ask the particants to bring a small phone/tablets to take photos. And somewhere I could possible print.\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

Big tech corporations, select media companies and closed governments control the content on the Internet, the data that flows across the Internet and how people connect to the Internet. This dystopian future is closer than you may think.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, what is the utopian version of the Internet in 2027? What future do we want to build? Where do emerging technologies like AI, mesh networking and Blockchain fit in? How do we ensure people are the most important part of the Internet?\r\n\r\nJoin us at Mozfest as we look into the future.

State-sponsored surveillance, theft of personal information, trolls arrogantly abusing others—this has become normal. And every day, many of us trade personal information for convenience.\r\n\r\nIt’s time to flip the script. Not everyone knows how to install a VPN or use encryption—but everyone should feel safe online. Can we imagine a future where manufacturers respect our safety by default when they build products? Where governments take steps to protect us? Can we find fun, new ways to engage our friends and neighbours around these issues?\r\n\r\nAt Mozfest, we’ll build, teach and play with these new approaches to Privacy & Security. Let’s put safety first.\r\n",

After the introduction, we'll introduce British wildlife to the audience and highlight how they can personally use technology too to monitor and assess wildlife in their own back gardens. We'll then explore how to build a DIY Naturebytes Wildlife Cam Kit (Pi-powered) and invite participants to build and deploy their own camera the same evening (that we will provide) to try and discover if there are urban foxes nearby.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nInspire the MozFest audience to use their digital making skills, often as a family, to aid the conservation of native wildlife here in the UK by using accessible technologies such as the Raspberry Pi and camera module to help assess wildlife populations. The evening event will also be family friendly, with a flask of tea and a chat outdoors whilst we deploy the cameras to highlight what else they may spot.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nWe will bring example sensors for participants to explore and will provide a limited number of Naturebytes Wildlife Cam Kits for the evening event workshop building them.\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

Digital inclusion is about making the web somewhere to celebrate and shout about skills, to share ideas and to be welcomed, regardless of what you think is cool or not. An online gallery will be created for MozFest attendees to share what is important to them.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nAccess to something to make on or with.\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

It's actually a tightly regulated process overseen by the Unicode Consortium, the non-profit organization based in Silicon Valley whose members are primarily US tech companies. It takes upwards of 18 months between when an emoji is proposed and when it can end up on your smartphone. A member of the Unicode Emoji Subcommittee and founder of Emojination will walk through the emoji proposal process, including the timelines, and the selection factors involved. Using successful proposals — including the DUMPLING emoji, as well as hijab emoji — the speakers will explain the dos and dont's of the process.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nOur aim is for people to understand the emoji proposal process, and feel empowered by it. Ideally we'll have folk who will be part of the \"normal folks\" who write emoji proposals — which is the equivalent of writing a very detailed high school lab report.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\n\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

Maybe there is just too much information, too much disagreement, too many decisions to be made.\n\nIf we didn't remove ourselves from decisions about climate change, about internet privacy, about so many matters, how would we cope? Would our emotions take over, would we sob, or scream, or fight, or hide?\n\n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nWhat if we view our world through a different lens? In this session we will meet artists and student who have collaborated to create pieces which expose fears and dreams of the future of the Internet.\n\nExplore how emotions, prejudices, experience and in-experience shape our collective vision of the Health of the Internet.\n\nThis will be enabled through discussion both of the works created during the accompanying MozFest Fringe Event at Exeter University and the process by which the works were created. \n\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

We need to consider what we sow as well as what, and how much, we consume. \r\n\r\nIn the Web Literacy space, we’ll dig into the skills that help us read, write and participate on the web in a way that enriches both it and ourselves. Web literacy isn’t just writing Python—it’s knowing how to wield a search engine, how to craft a strong password and when our online activities are being tracked. \r\n\r\nThrough hands-on workshops, participants will explore, make and play with the tools and technologies that form the fabric of the web. And through discussion and talks, we’ll invite our guests to reflect on, and improve, their relationship with the web. Our space will instill the skills and confidence in both young and old, students and teachers, to make the web a more vibrant, diverse ecosystem.\r\n",

We will introduce and begin to understand instruction, looping and selection through creating a dance sequence in groups. We then introduce lights already coded in Crumble that change according to audience interactions  that change the colour of the light. Each group of students will then take their movement sequence created and make it reactive to the different colour outcomes of the light that the audience is controlling.\n\nExample: Jump when the light is green, stop when the light is red, continue\nmovement sequence when the light is off.\n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe goal is to make coding accessible by introducing it through movement.  We approach it in two different ways, one through creating a group movement sequence and the other by becoming performers that are controlled by an audience through technology.  In both cases the participants begin to understand:\n-the need to be specific with instruction (by writing or 'coding' a dance movement and testing this on another group)\n-rule vs sequence based instructions by choreographing or 'coding'  their movements\n-different looping possibilities by choreographing or 'coding' movement\n-selection and looping by reacting to changing lights that the audience controls.  \n-testing, discussing and making improvements  \n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nOur requirements will be to have a large clear space where up to 35 people can move freely (10m x 10m) ideal.  We will bring all other equipment and will only require a couple plug points.  \n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

And every day, many of us trade personal information for convenience.\r\n\r\nIt’s time to flip the script. Not everyone knows how to install a VPN or use encryption—but everyone should feel safe online. Can we imagine a future where manufacturers respect our safety by default when they build products? Where governments take steps to protect us? Can we find fun, new ways to engage our friends and neighbours around these issues?\r\n\r\nAt Mozfest, we’ll build, teach and play with these new approaches to Privacy & Security.

Once the the first series of cognitive tests is completed the benevolent voice congratulates the subject/player and announces the next level. The subject repeats each test but now the VR systems manipulates their perception. This manipulation is hallucinatory in it’s nature. The user/players senses are increasingly distorted. \n\nBy the final level, the tests descend into absurdity where the user/player is unable to achieve what should be a simple task.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nTo entertain, and to create debate and discussion around the unexplored topic of privacy within virtual worlds.\n\nWhen completed, users receive a visualisation of all the data that has been collected throughout the subject/players engagement with the game. The report not only lists information about their physical body such as height and arm length but also more invasive information about their movement in the space during the game. The report also presents their level of engagement, concentration, agility and things that they have said with a sentiment analysis. Each of the user/players results are anonymously compares to each other. This report also gives a list all the data points that can be mined by VR systems. \n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nWe will provide our own HTC Vive system.\n\n\n### Time needed\nAll weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session\n",

To keep it this way, the technologies used to run the web should remain transparent and understandable.\r\n\r\nOpen Innovation is a space for challenging and learning about open source, open projects and growth on the web. We’ll investigate the challenges to open production (misinformation, draconian copyright) and the values of open creativity (working open techniques, tools and tactical transparency). The space is programmed as a highly-interactive platform for producing and protecting the principles of the open web. Join us in evolving our epically-open online world.\r\n",

The attendees will create a number of visualizations based on public data sets and we will discuss best ways of presenting data and engaging with the audience in order to make facts matter.\n\nThe session will consist of three parts:\n\n1. A brief demo of some of ways of exposing and visualizing data via The Gamma (http://thegamma.net).\n2. A hands-on part where attendees choose one of the provided data sets (or a custom one) and build their own visualizations.\n3. A more general discussion about how accessible and engaging data science can restore trust in statistics and facts.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nGovernments and journalists publish increasing amounts of raw data, but at the same time, “post-truth” has been chosen as the word of the year 2016 and the general public increasingly distrusts statistics. In other words, data science has new capabilities to help us understand the world, yet it is becoming less relevant in public discussion. This session will seek to answer the question: **What can we do to make facts backed by data more accessible and engaging?**\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nNo additional needs beyond a projector.\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

The biggest challenges within Fashion in developing countries are inputs for manufacturing such as zippers. This session challenges the issue of the zipper by experimenting and customising. Participants will get the opportunity to create prototypes that are innovative, tech-related, extraordinary or just geeky and fun. \nThey will leave the session with a self-made object, f.e. a sewn bag with a closure system, which could be a 3D print on the fabric.\nParticipants will be involved in a disruptive and participatory design process within Fashion. It will be demonstrated, that such an approach can be applied to many different areas.\n\n\n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThroughout this session, Fashion is an example of an empowering and sustainable disruptive design practice, which can facilitate change in emerging countries through applying a lean method. \n\nThis challenge has been addressed at the first Fashion Hackathon in East Africa, in December 2016, as part of a postgraduate research project at London College of Fashion.\n\nThis event turned out to be a very efficient and productive participatory design process. \n\nBy taking part in this Fashion Hackathon in Addis Ababa, the participants felt liberated of any design rules and norms. \n\nTheir 'responsive, frugal innovation design approach' was supported by Open Source knowledge. Their mind-set became unlimited on how to come up with possible solutions for any pressing problem and issue.\n\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\n3D printer\n\nLaser cutter\n\nFabrics\n\nMaterials\n\nCardboard\n\nSewing Machine\n\n\n### Time needed\nAll weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session\n",

In our pilot project, we will show how we have been working side-by-side with indigenous communities in Ecuador to collaboratively analyze data generated from the Media Cloud platform to better understand whether the narratives found in the media about these communities or issues important are being portrayed, misrepresented or ignored altogether. In addition, we have been working closely with these communities to model a new type of storytelling working with them to produce their own digital media responding to these data-based findings. \r\n\r\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\r\nWe would like attendees to have a better understanding how data can play a role in storytelling by marginalized communities. (example: https://newsframes.globalvoices.org/2017/07/22/in-the-depths-of-the-ecuadorian-amazon-digital-communications-aid-the-process-of-self-determination/) By sharing a concrete example of how we have been working with our pilot project communities through outreach, data analysis, and training, attendees will determine how a similar model may work with communities with whom they work. Following the presentation, we will provide plenty of time to invite feedback from attendees to help discuss challenges in this model or identify opportunities for creating a curriculum that can be utilized by others both as a self-guided or directed resource. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\r\nProjector + wifi\r\n\r\n\r\n### Time needed\r\n60 mins\r\n",

I am a stem cell scientist currently doing a PhD to understand congenital blindness. Many children I've met have been awe to know that you can be a complete nerd/geek but still be fashionable. I would like to share my work and background to inspire children to pursue STEM careers, but also want to open the pathways towards cross-disciplinary research (science, tech & art). I am looking to reveal my konichiwakitty e-fashion collection of at least 5 complete outfits (including accessories like gloves, hats, bags, umbrellas, jewellery and shoes) on the day. Perhaps a fashion show might be more attractive but I would need to recruit some human beings!\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThis is the first time I will be showcasing my entire collection so I'd like to be able to do it at the Science Fair on Friday. I think it's the best environment for people to come up and ask questions and have a more personal one-to-one conversation. I hope that wearable tech will gain more exposure and through this i could get some funding to expand my collection and ideas. I wish to break the stereotype and show the younger generation that you can be intelligent and also fashionable. Besides that, I also want to show that you can do anything you like (and more than one thing at a time) if you really have the passion for it.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nI would require some (5 or less) mannequins or a clothes rail to put up my wearable tech/clothing. Also some tables to display my electronic accessories would be great. If the admin deciding committee thinks that a fashion show would be the best idea, I will try to request for models via the social network but might need additional help finding 5 ladies of size UK8/10. \n\n\n### Time needed\nAll weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session\n",

            "description": "**Space Description**\r\nDo you feel safe online?\r\n\r\nSometimes, online security can feel unattainable. State-sponsored surveillance, theft of personal information, trolls arrogantly abusing others—this has become normal. And every day, many of us trade personal information for convenience.\r\n\r\nIt’s time to flip the script. Not everyone knows how to install a VPN or use encryption—but everyone should feel safe online. Can we imagine a future where manufacturers respect our safety by default when they build products? Where governments take steps to protect us? Can we find fun, new ways to engage our friends and neighbours around these issues?\r\n\r\nAt Mozfest, we’ll build, teach and play with these new approaches to Privacy & Security. Let’s put safety first.\r\n",

At Global Voices, we’ve created a journalism platform called NewsFrames (https://newsframes.globalvoices.org) to help make this easier.  It enables people to write stories together on news coverage in ways that incorporates data, analytical methods, and bridge-building perspectives.\n\nSome data that NewsFrames incorporates is from Media Cloud (mediacloud.org) and from an experimental library of algorithms from Georgia Institute of Technology that we’re calling “Bias Detector.”  Our session will show how these tools can enable collaborative writing about frames or agenda setting in news coverage.  \n\nBecause NewsFrames is new and still undergoing some development, we also welcome feedback from the participants that can inform its use and future.\n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nAfter this session, participants should understand how to write an article that compares different dominant themes in news coverage by different outlets like this one: https://newsframes.globalvoices.org/2017/07/07/what-does-the-media-say-is-happening-in-venezuela/.\n\nIn addition, participants will have experience in a new, open software platform that encourages best practices and enables collaboration in news authorship. \n\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nWe will require a computer with internet/wifi connection and projector to demo the software. In addition, if there are not a lot of participants, those attending can bring their laptop/tablet with a connection to participate actively in the session. \n\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

As part of their acceptence into the youth zone we are requesting they take part in the fire side chat on the Youth Internet of health project.\r\n\r\nEach participant will be asked to share with us what one of the 5 themes means to them based on:\r\n\r\n    Privacy & Security\r\n    Openness\r\n    Decentralization\r\n    Digital Inclusion\r\n    Web Literacy\r\n\r\nhttps://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health\r\n\r\nAs a pre cursar to this they will have been asked to post their blog on Medium.com to start off their reflection on the above themes; again writing a blog is part and parcel of being accepted into the Youth Zone as this year MozFest is so \"Themed\". For a youth audience we felt it was best to help them reflect on how their session fits within, intersects and/or address's one or more of the 5 main themes set out in the internet of health report, rather than us tell them.\r\n\r\nTo achive this we are drawing from a number of sessions who have submitted to MozFest and have been accepted within the Youth Zone to help us set the stage and deliver training on the Friday together with set homework on their \"Themed\" choice to go research the topic in the themed space. This to fully support our young people being confident in standing up for 5-7 minutes to let us know what the report means to them.\r\n\r\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\r\nThis will be an eddited filmed event, we want our youth to get a taste of what it feels like to be filmed while talking. This while giving them the reasurance that it's ok to \"Mess up talking on stage\". Public speaking is a daunting task to many and only through the doing can we start to be more confortable with the experience itself. The objectives of this session are 2 fold: (A) Be a gaint sand box for our youth experience public speaking and (B) Record the views of our youth on what Mozilla has set out in their Internet of health report,  youth being the ones who are going to have to pick up the batton to carry on fighting for a free internet for all.\r\n\r\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\r\nHire of a camera for the weekend\r\n\r\n### Time needed\r\nAfternoon slots in room 213 Fri, Sat and Sun.\r\n",

State-sponsored surveillance, theft of personal information, trolls arrogantly abusing others—this has become normal. And every day, many of us trade personal information for convenience.\r\n\r\nIt’s time to flip the script. Not everyone knows how to install a VPN or use encryption—but everyone should feel safe online. Can we imagine a future where manufacturers respect our safety by default when they build products? Where governments take steps to protect us? Can we find fun, new ways to engage our friends and neighbours around these issues?\r\n\r\nAt Mozfest, we’ll build, teach and play with these new approaches to Privacy & Security. Let’s put safety first.\r\n",

Often well meaning, but naive, solutions to real problems (e.g. harassment) end up also harming queer communities the most and once we understand that not only can be we make the lives of queer people better, but we can also improve the internet for everyone.\n\nI am hoping the group discussion unearths some clever solutions that participants can take forward also.\n\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

A story will be created for the participants to make up. One of the participants will be writing an encrypted message using the Caesar Cipher after they have completed the message the other 4-5 people will attempt to decipher it. \n\nAfter the participants have mastered the way of using a code or codes they will have to look around the building for coded messages for them to find and the winner will receive a special award. They also have to search twitter for hidden messages to archive the final challenge.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nMy goal of the session is to share my knowledge to other people for them to comprehend what cryptography is really about. \nCryptography is a useful skill to learn because it is used for keeping your personal information safe and without it everything on the internet would be open sourced and people could read your personal information such as your bank details or your email password.

Being new to the scene things can be a little scary, especially in spaces that seem very technical. With any team, diversity matter. Producing documentation, recording process, and sharing resources are important in keeping up relations in open source spaces so we can better innovate together. \n\nHere we will have an open discussion on file management, team communication, design hand-offs, and more. We'll share real team challenges, successes, and solutions. We will come away with a shared doc of our tips, tricks, and resources for working as teams in the open. \n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nI want people to walk away with clear suggestions on how their teams can better communicate on their projects moving forward and have a list of resources and tools that may aid them. By the end of our time together we should create a shared document with our compiled tips and tricks for team communication and collaboration that has worked in different situations. \n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nWe may need stickies and pens that way we can see what ideas are most popular so we can prioritize discussion. \n\nAttendees should bring their computers to take notes for our shared document. We can also share computers or have designated note takers. \n\n\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

The T4SJ research project is a participatory action research co-led by Research Action Design (RAD), Open Technology Institute (OTI) and their nine partner organizations. \nWe will have visualizations, practitioners' stories, and interactive displays that will show the results of our one year research documenting, mapping, and analyzing the space many of us hold using technology for social good. \n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nWe spent half of 2016 and most of 2017 trying to understand how people that work with technology to advance social good and social justice come into this field. How those that use technology in the public’s interest define the space they work in and how they see the challenges and the threats they face. Our goal is to share these findings and much more with the MozFest Community. \n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nWe will need a projector, an exhibition area, and easels. \n\n\n### Time needed\nAll weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session\n",

Following this, the participants will be able to 3D scan themselves and we will critique what it feels like to have a second virtual self. \n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe primary goal of the session is to generate an understanding of how 3D scanning works, the history of digitization and how it documents certain narratives online, as well as critique the process. Ultimately making the connection between computer vision and understanding the importance of diverse online representations in imagery, and in future, digital renditions of humanness in virtual formats. \n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nWe would require wifi, a projector and a screen.

In 2014, BetaNYC was commissioned to develop an intro to open data course. It quickly became apparent that every day user environments would limit how the class could be taught. In 2015, BetaNYC started to develop novel approaches to teach within internet limited environments. In this session, we will walk you through our pedagogy and lead you to a road where the internet is limited, the data is limitless, and a card game is your guide. Join us for an hour-long journey to discuss data literacy, algorithms, civic architecture, and algorithms.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nParticipants will walk out of the session with a “mad libs” / “Cards Against Humanity” deck of cards and a new approach as how to teach civic / municipal data in an internet / computer constrained environment. Additionally, they will learn how to use municipal data as a tool for education, empowerment, and self-determination. This session will briefly talk about identifying community partners, teachable key data values, and how to build a deck of physical cards that enable the student to narrate and discuss data in a no-internet environment. At the end, we hope to gather feedback to improve the card game and discuss a shared space to share insights across the smart cities digital/literacy divide.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nWhile we can host this conversation without a projector, we desire a projector and electrical outlets.\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

We'll then share what the actual platform decided. \nThen they'll brainstorm ways they can support friends (or anyone) on the internet that they see experiencing harassment. \nFinally, each group will choose a platform and brainstorm ways to work with, or around it, to prevent harassment (our tool Squadbox is one example of this.)\nIn the end we'll ask each group to briefly present important points from their conversation, and add our own thoughts.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe goal is twofold. \nFirst, to give participants a better understanding of online harassment in general: how it manifests itself on various platforms, how there is no consensus on what exactly it is, and the impacts it can have on individuals and online communities. \nSecondly, to empower participants to take action. They will learn how they can help people experiencing it in non-technical ways, as well as how interface and system design, and platform policies, can have an impact on whether, and how, users experience harassment. We aim to give them the tools they need to think critically about how to combat and prevent harassment through better design and innovative solutions that work around or with existing platforms. \n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nProjector, paper, pens\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

Stories are also positioned as layers to show the intersectionality of stories, how eras can be defined, and how struggles move through cycles. Many of us live the stories of our movements’ histories, but lack tools to see how our stories intersect with histories of struggle. In this political climate, it's crucial to place our stories in historical context and challenge dominant narratives. In our workshop, participants can share stories and find connections between our diverse peoples' histories.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nOur goal is to provide participants with a digital tool to build a dynamic, timeline of online stories that demonstrate the power of diverse stories on an open Internet. As partisan battles shift communications policy with attempts to dismantle a neutral Internet, an online tool that aggregates personal stories and alternative histories is a crucial representation of the heterogeneity of the web. It is our hope that building these digital timelines will deepen the analysis of how stories we see and create are linked to history. We will see how the backdrop of history can be used to present a broader, more embracing perspective of our connected communities through stories we share and explore online.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nLaptops connected to the Internet for attendees who do not have an online device would be helpful. However, smartphones and tablets can be used for this workshop, although the interface may be a bit tight on a small screen.\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

And through discussion and talks, we’ll invite our guests to reflect on, and improve, their relationship with the web.

But fake news itself is not new, and librarians have been combating fake news for years. With a longstanding focus on supporting information literacy, and a more recent focus on digital and media literacy, librarians have long helped people learn the skills they need to find, use, and create information. This session plans to bring librarians and partners together for a curriculum mapping session. Participants will explore a news and web literacy curriculum called Mission:Information. After an opening discussion about how librarians can, and do, combat fake news, participants will collaboratively map the Mission:Information curriculum to work happening in libraries and will develop plans to adapt and use the curriculum in libraries. \n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThis proposed session aims to be highly collaborative, participatory, and audience-driven. The main goals are, first, to introduce participants to issues and concerns related to fake news, and to examine how librarians work to combat fake news. The next goal is to give participants an opportunity to explore, and consider ways to use, an open-source news and web literacy curriculum called Mission:Information. Finally, the last goal is to engage participants in a curriculum mapping and brainstorming session where they can contribute their ideas and skills and work on mapping and adapting the curriculum for use in libraries. Participants will guide the direction of the session and determine the focus of the discussion and mapping and brainstorming sessions. \n\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

Web literacy isn’t just writing Python—it’s knowing how to wield a search engine, how to craft a strong password and when our online activities are being tracked. \r\n\r\nThrough hands-on workshops, participants will explore, make and play with the tools and technologies that form the fabric of the web. And through discussion and talks, we’ll invite our guests to reflect on, and improve, their relationship with the web. Our space will instill the skills and confidence in both young and old, students and teachers, to make the web a more vibrant, diverse ecosystem.\r\n",

We will use simple online tools like RawGraphs, Databasic, Tableau and other user-friendly tools to build visualizations of three datasets.  We will demonstrate how we cleaned these sets and developed the final visualizations. Facilitators will be there to help participants follow along with the instructors on their computers. We will share some dos and don’ts on how to make an easy to understand data visualization for a general audience. \nAfter the demonstrations, we will answer general questions about how to get started with data visualization, and we will provide a list of resources for participants to continue their data viz journey. \n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nWe all have the open data fever, but not all of us know how to analyze, visualize,  or understand data beyond pie charts, graphs, and percentages. This session aims to bring those that have limited experience with data and get them started with using simple online tools.\n\nIn a nutshell, when participants leave our session, they will have practiced visualizing a dataset, they have an idea of what to look for in a dataset, and they will know where to find more resources to continue their data viz adventure.\n\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nWe will need a projector and a mic.\n\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

We will talk about how radio transmission works and the advantages to having it as a parallel tool with the internet for sharing and receiving information.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThere are very outdated prediction models for where a radio station can reach. The better tools are proprietary and only available as part of expensive software. By using the community involvement that underpins open mapping and other crowd assisted data collection, we can gather the empirical data to help with developing an open prediction model to be used by community radio folks and others. Folks need a little hardware to help however, and this will be a way to get them started and to help us make sure that our steps are clear and that we can work out any problems and try better approaches all together.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nWe will need some hardware for the session and if the session is selected will figure out based on the advice of folks who have run MozFest sessions in past how many we'll need and if there is support for ordering, if not we will find a way to supply them.\n\n\n### Time needed\nless than 60 mins\n",

We will start by showing a Youreka Science video explaining preprints and their usefulness for scientific advancement, followed by updates on the status of preprints in biology, and then open the floor for questions. In our next segment, “Think BIG”, we will ask participants, \"What is your vision for how research is communicated and rewarded in the future?\" We hope to inspire participants to think BIG about alternatives to the current publishing system. We will conclude by presenting our Preprint Journal Club Starter Kit project to exemplify how an idea born during a Mozilla workshop can give rise to a collaborative project.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nAccording to a 2016 survey conducted by the scientist-driven preprint advocacy group ASAPbio, a whopping 91% of scientists expressed dissatisfaction with the current publishing system. As a result of ASAPbio’s efforts, preprints have become more widely adopted in the biological sciences, but there are still many scientists that are unaware or misinformed as to what preprints are and how they can benefit science. We aim to educate scientists about how preprints can revolutionize the way we communicate scientific progress, and promote the open access and open use of scientific research to aid rapid progression and collaboration within science. \n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nOur session does not require additional materials, but we may require additional time as we are hoping to organize a panel of representatives from different preprint stakeholders who are at MozFest or located in London, for example Naomi Penfold or Giuliano Maciocci from eLIFE, and Robert Kiley from the Wellcome Trust, as well as representatives from different career stages in academia. As we have not yet reached out to these stakeholders, we did not include this in our session plan above.\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

Our proposed session brings together the wider computing education ecosystem including the NYC Department of Education, the Processing Foundation, and the Browning School, a private preparatory school. Together, we seek to engage practitioners and educators in building a new vision for CS education that puts students first. Through three breakout groups participants will 1) explore how code can be used for creative and personal expression; 2) brainstorm how we might teach student the ethical implications of computing; and 3) provide feedback and contribute to the open source CS4All Blueprint. \n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nOver the past few years the CS4All NYC team has observed numerous challenges and opportunities through scaling computing education in the U.S.’ largest school system, serving over 1.1 million students. By sharing our lessons learned, gathering feedback on our open-source Blueprint, co-creating new resources, we hope to inspire others to grow creative and ethical computing education in their own communities. We will also facilitate an online community that shares updates, projects, and experiences in the program. This session will thus improve computing education by creating wider global engagement in the movement. \n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nNone.\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

Hackathon to Increase Accessibility to the African Rock Art Image Project at the British Museum\n**[ Primary Space ]** Digital Inclusion\n**[ Secondary Space ]** Open Innovation\n\n\n**[ Submitter's Name ]** Jennifer Wexler\n**[ Submitter's Affiliated Organisation ]** British Museum\n\n\n**[ Additional facilitators ]** Elizabeth Galvin\n\n\n### What will happen in your session?\nThe African Rock Art Image Project at the British Museum (www.britishmuseum.org/africanrockart) was launched in 2013 to catalogue, curate and make publicly accessible a collection of 24,000 images from 19 countries across Africa. As the BM's first research project dealing primarily with digital collections, the project has been experimenting with a series of innovative digital tools, including 3D modeling, 3D printing, and interactive VR experiences, to order to develop new and inventive ways of engaging with the rock art data. This session will focus on what we have learned in the 4 years of running a major digital heritage project in a museum environment, and how we can use digital technology to ensure ongoing, global open access to the archive.\n\n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nSince the central remit of the project is to ensure global open access to our archival data, we propose a session to look at developing new and innovative ways of engaging with the archive, with emphasis on finding low-cost solutions to increase accessibility in low-bandwidth regions and on mobile devices. We will enable access to 'hack' our collections data, and to create fun and innovative solutions. How can we use archival data to innovate and engage? Experimentation, digital inclusion, and open access tools will be central themes we will be looking at.\n\nThis could either be via a single session or through a weekend long installation as either works well with what we can demonstrate and teach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nProjector and office supplies, power points, whiteboards, wifi access, and personal devices.\n\n\n### Time needed\nAll weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session\n",

Each group will apply the methods they've brainstormed to manipulate their data set and meet their political goals. \n\nAt the end, each group or participant will present their work to the rest of the workshop, who will guess at what methods they employed.

Big tech corporations, select media companies and closed governments control the content on the Internet, the data that flows across the Internet and how people connect to the Internet. This dystopian future is closer than you may think.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, what is the utopian version of the Internet in 2027? What future do we want to build? Where do emerging technologies like AI, mesh networking and Blockchain fit in? How do we ensure people are the most important part of the Internet?\r\n\r\nJoin us at Mozfest as we look into the future.

Turing researchers are from a plethora of university departments ranging from mathematics and computer science to linguistics, psychiatry, civil engineering and law, and collaborate with partners in many industries, including finance, healthcare and national security. In our session we will present our efforts to build a culture of research that is \"reproducible from the beginning\" and \"open by default\".\n\nWe will showcase the training curriculum we have curated for PhD students, guidelines on data management for senior investigators starting projects, and open toolkits that make studies more efficient throughout their research cycle. We will also discuss the challenges associated with analysing proprietary data, protecting intellectual property and ensuring patient confidentiality.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nAlthough the strength of the Turing Institute is its diversity and interdisciplinary focus, this is also what makes our goal of building a culture of reproducible research so challenging. Wrangling a diverse set of academics from different disciplines and with a variety of domain specific publishing norms makes it difficult to come up with guidelines that work for all.\n\nThe selfish goal of our session is to engage MozFest participants who have experience working in similar environments and learn from their experiences. We also hope that members of research departments of all levels of seniority will be inspired to follow our lead and nurture an open and reproducible culture in their own institute.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nWe do not need any additional materials beyond post-it notes, pens and papers, and a projector. We will provide our own laptop and all session materials will be available online.\n\n\n### Time needed\nless than 60 mins\n",

I want to talk about solutions that provide simple ways for learners to evaluate content along standardized metrics developed by professional journalists and data scientists. \n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nYou know 'fake news' is a problem, now we need to find real solutions to fix it. My goal in the session is to inspire people to see we all have agency in this -- that we need to reclaim the web as an open and positive solution to the challenges of filter bubbles, fake news and apathy. \n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nHave HDMI plug. Will travel :) \n\n\n### Time needed\nless than 60 mins\n",

We will explain how “catchers” help answer research questions via the game. We will then open the following question: “YOU are helping us generate data. How should we make these data accessible to YOU?” We will demonstrate some examples and visualizations, and ask participants to brainstorm and suggest their own. Topics to cover also include: the rights, concerns, and privacy issues that participants have related to opening data, what would the participants use the data for, how much research context they would like to receive, do any creative (not just research) opportunities arise with opening data, such as serendipitous discovery.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nAs a citizen science project, enabled by the people and for the people, we are passionate about making volunteer-generated data available to volunteers. The main goal of the session is to gather feedback from the community about what kinds of open data they would like available via Stall Catchers, and in what format. By hearing directly from participants, we can make sure we maximize the impact and learning opportunities created by opening data. Moreover, participants may suggest new interface elements in Stall Catchers that would help provide the research context, open data and educational materials in the most accessible way.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nProjector and office supplies.\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

Members of BuildBrighton Hackerspace will share their tips for a design that has been fully tested and bring extra materials for new ideas. There will be time to do at least one test image and discuss troubleshooting solutions for known issues.  \n\nAfternoon \nEach participant will be able to use the scanner and explore photogrammetry software to convert their images to 3D. Participants with PC’s will be able to download the software and others can use our computers to convert their pictures during the workshop or take them home on a memory stick.\n\nParticipants can attend one or both sessions.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nTo make 3D body scanners more accessible and affordable by sharing our open source design that can be made for less than £1000. \nTo provide people with a hands on activity, that can build confidence in making with digital technology, in a fun supportive environment.\nTo co-create improvements such as tweaks to the structure, lighting or coding.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\n\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

Web literacy isn’t just writing Python—it’s knowing how to wield a search engine, how to craft a strong password and when our online activities are being tracked. \r\n\r\nThrough hands-on workshops, participants will explore, make and play with the tools and technologies that form the fabric of the web. And through discussion and talks, we’ll invite our guests to reflect on, and improve, their relationship with the web. Our space will instill the skills and confidence in both young and old, students and teachers, to make the web a more vibrant, diverse ecosystem.\r\n",

Big tech corporations, select media companies and closed governments control the content on the Internet, the data that flows across the Internet and how people connect to the Internet. This dystopian future is closer than you may think.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, what is the utopian version of the Internet in 2027? What future do we want to build? Where do emerging technologies like AI, mesh networking and Blockchain fit in? How do we ensure people are the most important part of the Internet?\r\n\r\nJoin us at Mozfest as we look into the future.

We share a similar mindset, we attend the same events, we support each other’s work, we advocate for an “open by default” world.\n \nNow we’d like to ask: what are opportunities for joining forces? How can we collaborate for even greater impact? And what story about the “Big Open”can we tell, to encourage stronger collaboration? We’re collecting ideas around four major themes: community, policy, organisation, common narratives. Join us for a conversation about how to be open together. \n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nIn this session, we are eager to work with participants from the free and open scene to identify common goals and discuss forms of collaboration. Each player in this field has their specific focus, and we would like to map opportunities, ideas and thoughts for a more collaborative future – together we can be bigger than the sum of our parts! \n\nWe are aiming at identifying synergies as well as contacts from different organizations and networks who are interested in working together and fostering the ties between the different Open Movement players. \n\nInsights from this session will feed into a broader discussion that we will be conducting over the coming months. \n\n\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nSticky notes and sharpies. \n\n\nThe session itself will be 90 mins long and – after a brief introduction – be interactive instead of lecture style. We would like to add some drop-in time (2 hours) for informal conversations afterwards, so that people can immediately connect and build upon the outcomes of the session.\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

The most substantial part of the session consist of an interactive exercise: we present different kinds of courses we currently have and provide full personas, next the participants break down the courses into bite-sized information based on the personas. Participants take complex, web based technical subject matter and make it easy to understand.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nWe hope the participants gain a greater understanding of the benefits of bite-sized learning and how delivering relevant information in an efficient way through the internet can really transform the lives of vulnerable people, making them more independent, confident and resourceful.  We also hope that the interactive exercise enhances their confidence in breaking down new information and challenges into thin slices and addressing learning objectives one by one. From our side we aim to gain new insight by the participants feedback, questions and group discussion. We would like to have the feedback from the wider MozFest community as its diverse in cultures, experiences and personalities so we are making sure that Soul Medicine is inclusive. \n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nWe would only need some large sheets of paper, say A3, post its and markers/pens.\n\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

True web literacy involves continually learning, questioning, collaborating, and sharing information with others in your community. How do you design learning activities that empower participants to become web literacy leaders?\n\nIn this session, Web Literacy Leaders Joanna and Kelly will share their experience designing web literacy training for staff who serve public library patrons and military veterans. Session participants will share their own learning experiences and brainstorm ideas for integrating leadership development into trainings. Participants will then break into groups to design an activity that teaches a web literacy skill of their choice, using \"every learner a leader\" as a guiding principle for curriculum development.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nAt the end of this session, participants will:\n- Be thinking about learning as an ongoing process\n- Have skills and ideas to strengthen existing curricula\n- Have designed and shared new web literacy curricula\n\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nProjector and post-it notes should be enough.\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

We will use openly available data and code and will, hopefully, arrive at the same conclusions as the published work. I will introduce the Brain Networks in Python toolkit (https://github.com/WhitakerLab/BrainNetworksInPython) and discuss the areas that need to be developed to ensure this software is useful for the open science community. The session will end by brainstorming the interoperability of the Brain Networks in Python software with other open source projects in network visualisation (eg Cytoscape js; http://js.cytoscape.org), the docker-powered Brain Imaging Data Structure Apps (http://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io) or novel network measures (https://github.com/mwshinn/versatility).\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nWe have three specific goals for our session, tailored to the experience and background of our participants. The following three categories are overlapping and non-exhaustive!\n\nFor neuroscience or network science newbies, we will demonstrate the power of understanding the brain as a network using graph theory.\n\nFor researchers, we will motivate the importance of working reproducibly from the beginning of a project. We will also discuss the challenges associated with reproducible research and brainstorm ways to overcome these barriers.\n\nFor developers (at any level of expertise), we will welcome them into the Brain Networks in Python community and orient them to the open development on GitHub, ensuring they know where to find our guidelines for contributing, roadmap and open issues.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nWe do not need any additional materials beyond post-it notes, pens and papers, and a projector. We will provide our own laptop and all tutorial materials wil be available online.\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

Become part of the scientific research process! All you need is a web browser.\nWe want to \ngo with our participants on an exploration tour through the amazing neuroanatomy of the brain. We developed a Web app that allows people to work on brain imaging data in the browser – on phones, tablets, or computers.\nwe want to engage our participants into a real-time synchronised collaboration on real brain imaging data and together participate in the scientific research process. \n\nJoin the fun, join research, become part of our citizen neuroscientist crowd!\n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nFor all participants from any background, we aim at: \ncreating a community of people willing to discover the brain together, actively experiencing research in an open & collaborative environment. We would like to welcome everyone into our community and show them how easy it is to join and make a contribution to science. \nempowering our participants with what they need to continue as autonomous citizen-neuroscientists beyond the time of the Mozilla Festival. We will explore together brain data and learn about it. Participants will learn about the neocortex, its role and its variability across humans and other species.\nlearning how non-neuroscientists approach the tasks involved in the manual delineation of brain structure to improve our tools and create open teaching material\n\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nIf there was a possibility of having an additional tablet, ideally with a stylus or pen, we would be happy to use those during our session since the collaborative drawing/delineation of brain regions is so much fun and allows you a very intuitive insight into the data. Otherwise we will use the ones that we can bring plus the phones of our participants :)\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

While we focus on the 10-14 age group and their educators, the approach and materials support learners and learning spaces of all kinds.\nWe will share prototypes and discuss our work with designer Roland Ellis and London-based creative team Artists & Engineers. Topics to be covered include: 1) content and instructional frameworks; 2) outreach and community; 3) interface design and user interaction; 4) the hardware and software stack. We are eager for the MozFest community's input as we work on decentralizing civic and scientific data to help young people better understand and shape their worlds.\n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nSince this work happens at the intersection of data, edtech, and the open web with a focus on science, literacy and connected learning, the Mozilla community is uniquely suited to improve this project. Our goals at Mozfest and in this session are to find collaborators -- coders, designers, educators, advocates -- who may be interested to engage with this work and, most importantly, localize this it in their networks and communities.\n\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

Participants can learn how to capture 3D imagery of archaeological objects with the phone in their pocket, or their low spec compact digital camera; how to use open source technology to create crowd sourcing projects (via our AHRC funded MicroPasts project platform) that can aid the documentation and mission of Museums worldwide. We will enable object handling through the use of tactile 3D prints and access to VR activities using Google Cardboard for African Rock Art or our portfolio of Sketchfab 3D models. \n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThis session aims to show that high impact engagement tools are easily within the reach of heritage professionals and institutions without the need for high cost tools and software. It will demonstrate and equip participants with basic skills to create 3D, or to create a crowdsourcing application on the Pybossa powered MicroPasts platform. It is hoped that it will inspire others to go down the opensource, open access route for democratisation of our cultural heritage. \n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nWe will provide all materials.\n\n\n### Time needed\nAll weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session\n",

State-sponsored surveillance, theft of personal information, trolls arrogantly abusing others—this has become normal. And every day, many of us trade personal information for convenience.\r\n\r\nIt’s time to flip the script. Not everyone knows how to install a VPN or use encryption—but everyone should feel safe online. Can we imagine a future where manufacturers respect our safety by default when they build products? Where governments take steps to protect us? Can we find fun, new ways to engage our friends and neighbours around these issues?\r\n\r\nAt Mozfest, we’ll build, teach and play with these new approaches to Privacy & Security. Let’s put safety first.\r\n",

After unsuccessfully trying to get survivors to feedback on the 70 page draft, we decided to experiment and filled the guide with cat GIFs. Suddenly, we got lots of responses from survivors and charities. It made online safety accessible. But this hasn't gone far enough. Women still find the more complicated aspects of online safety overwhleming. Metaphors & GIFs give us an opportunity to make this content more fun and relatable, especially for people experiencing abuse, depression, bullying, PTSD or whose first language isn't English. Come help us figure out how this can be done and come up with templates.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\n(1) To raise awareness of unique challenges of understanding complex instructions (that may seem simple) to people experiencing abuse, depression, bullying and PTSD\n(2) To come up with ideas for new kind of GIFs and how to videos that don't require audio voiceovers\n(3) To come up with catchy cross-cultural metaphors to explain web and social safety tips \n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nPost its\nMarkers\nA screen to project GIFs to\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

Michael Spikes will lead a slide show and dialogue based on his years of experience and hundreds of public talks on the topic, and Michael Hannan will share the lessons and projects that Chicago teachers have created based on professional development, one-on-one coaching, and program support. Two slide shows will explore themes from this collaboration for 45 minutes. For the final 15 minutes, attendees will examine news artifacts, assessing their newsworthiness. \n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe presenters hope to spread the word about news literacy, a critical element of media literacy, web literacy, and civic involvement. Educators and researchers have explored this topic for years. Yet the importance of developing news literacy as a serious area of research, educational explorations, and dissemination has recently expanded. Educators, nonprofits, and social media are entering the debate over “fake news’, its consequences, and the most effective approach to combating the viral spread of misinformation. Proposals for community whistleblowing and internal review and removal of posts and tweets have been discussed and explored. This session will bring awareness of this debate and make recommend improved education as the first step to reducing the harm caused by web-misinformation. \n\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nWe will need a projector and office supplies.

A weekend-long drop-in storytelling installation — a simple booth where participants can interview others — **including folks not physically at MozFest**, tell their story, code a story using Hypothes.is, and read/listen to others’ voices (NOTE: We're writing a brief for Ravensbourne students to see if they have ideas on ways to amplify this session and the human connections beyond the physical space.) \r\n2. A series of introductory 60-minute \"how-to sessions\" to introduce folks to the [StoryEngine methodology](https://storyengine.io/about/) and provide a sense of how it works and the confidence to set up one of their own (these can happen in English, French, and passable Spanish)\r\n\r\nStoryEngine is the Mozilla Foundation’s deep listening, learning, and impact narrative methodology. While celebrating and amplifying the work of individuals and organizations, StoryEngine powers a feedback and engagement loop. The result: new examples, illuminated change pathways, and a better sense of others' successes, challenges, and needs. Most importantly, the act of listening is super satisfying! It's a great opportunity to make connections, spark ideas, and build skills.\r\n\r\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\r\n\r\n- MozFest amplified and extended beyond the walls of Ravensbourne — and beyond one weekend\r\n- More and deeper long-term — and cross-silo! — connections \r\n- Participants experience themselves as part of a broader network or movement\r\n- Inclusion advanced and open innovation networks strengthened because of a better understanding of each others’ context, successes, challenges, solutions, and desired collaborators\r\n- Opportunities for participants to generate ideas together, amplify each others’ voices, and connect in practical ways\r\n- Open leadership, participatory listening, interviewing, and qualitative data analysis skills introduced or advanced\r\n- A set of rich narratives and evidence about the people and organizations touched by Mozilla, including examples of pathways and experiences\r\n- Perceptions of internet health and working open surfaced and discussed \r\n- Ideas on how to shape and improve StoryEngine, for Mozilla as well as for others\r\n\r\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\r\nWe'd want to create a small StoryEngine studio where folks can record each other with audio. We can hack together something cool with thin plywood (or cardboard) and eggshell foam. The outside could feature images and callout texts from prior interviews, and places to sit and engage with the stories — and with each other. We're using Hypothes.is to code stories so we can invite others to join in the \"sensemaking\" — wither using their own laptop or ones we have available — and we could have bigger chunks of texts with sticky notes where people could do lo-fi \"tagging\". \r\n\r\n### Time needed\r\nAll weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session\r\n",

And through discussion and talks, we’ll invite our guests to reflect on, and improve, their relationship with the web.

State-sponsored surveillance, theft of personal information, trolls arrogantly abusing others—this has become normal. And every day, many of us trade personal information for convenience.\r\n\r\nIt’s time to flip the script. Not everyone knows how to install a VPN or use encryption—but everyone should feel safe online. Can we imagine a future where manufacturers respect our safety by default when they build products? Where governments take steps to protect us? Can we find fun, new ways to engage our friends and neighbours around these issues?\r\n\r\nAt Mozfest, we’ll build, teach and play with these new approaches to Privacy & Security. Let’s put safety first.\r\n",

To keep it this way, the technologies used to run the web should remain transparent and understandable.\r\n\r\nOpen Innovation is a space for challenging and learning about open source, open projects and growth on the web. We’ll investigate the challenges to open production (misinformation, draconian copyright) and the values of open creativity (working open techniques, tools and tactical transparency). The space is programmed as a highly-interactive platform for producing and protecting the principles of the open web. Join us in evolving our epically-open online world.\r\n",

We invite you for a test of what it can do. We will be designing actions to counter a dystopian reality of the Internet owned by a powerful few, big corporations and media moguls. This session will be a fastpacing intro to direct action as a way of building movements and taking matters of internet freedom into our own hands, as well as a session where we can start crafting a toolbox for the open internet movement.    \n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe participants will get insights to creative direct action design through the Beautiful Trouble suite of strategic tools and will be added to the network of more than houndreds of activists from around the globe practicing direct action for a more equitable world. Through the use of the toolbox we will spark participants imagination through the design of direct actions that they can hopefully take with them when they build their own campaigns for a decentralized internet.\nWe hope that some of the participants would like to even contribute to the toolkit with their own stories as a way of sowing the seeds for a toolbox for the open internet movement. \n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nFlipchart, markers, sticky notes, weird hats and ponies!\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

First, through storytelling, we will describe how the Crowd2Map Tanzania project was created - by accident - during Mozfest 2015. In two years it grew into a grassroots project with 1000+ volunteers that makes a difference in Tanzania. All with limited resources, local challenges and a shoestring budget. Participants will be encouraged to ask questions and participate in an organic discussion. Secondly, based on participants’ own ideas, we will run a practical workshop & do some of the first steps of setting up a project, i.e. at least one of the following: set up a blog, a Facebook page and/or a mailing list, so the projects can begin growing the community right away.\r\n\r\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\r\nThe main goal of the session is to share good practices of the Crowd2Map Tanzania project and demonstrate how easy it can be to begin a grassroots project & run it. Especially if you start with community building. Participants will leave the session with some of first steps of setting up the project already achieved, so they can get a head start in growing their project. They will have gained practical advice and inspiration to bring their projects forward. \r\n\r\n\r\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\r\nJust a projector and office supplies.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Time needed\r\n90 mins\r\n",

We will demonstrate “Build Your Own Algorithm,” a new activity that helps learners new to the topic understand how algorithms work. In an idea-generating activity, we will then ask our participants to help us create a second activity that can deepen our learners’ understanding of this topic. \n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nTo be a healthy individual, it’s important to understand how your mind works. From learning new behaviors to shedding unhealthy perspectives, meditation on how your world view developed is an important early step. From an Internet Health perspective, a similar approach is necessary when it comes to one of the more hidden actors on the web: the algorithm.\n\nAt the conclusion of this session, participants will be able to:\n\n- Share how our human biases end up informing many of the systems we use\n- Teach the concept of the algorithm to those who haven’t yet been exposed to them\n- Develop an activity that teaches algorithms more deeply\n- Share how understanding algorithms fits into the framework of Internet Health\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nwe're all good, thanks!\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

Team members from Resilient Communities NYC will use a bad theatre demo and a hands-on workshop to share tools and strategies for creating a portable local wireless network in a pinch. The PNK (Portable Network Kits) session will highlight the very real problem of communication during a disaster. The session will visualize portable and accessible solutions, and then participants will work together to build and deploy local battery-powered WiFi networks. While the PNK can serve as an internet gateway under normal circumstances, it can also work in “island mode” in an emergency: an autonomous community resource for local apps, services, and data.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nHow will your local community communicate when a disaster hits? Participants will walk away with skills to assemble, configure, and deploy a portable network kit (PNK). We will also introduce them to the many potential uses and adaptations of the PNK, including the ability to create and mobilize autonomous, locally-controlled information systems for self-determination, mutual aid, and digital sovereignty. Participants will walk away with concrete skills, a how-to guide, and the challenge to use the PNK to gain greater ownership and control over their digital presence.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nA simple HDMI connection to a video projector or large monitor would be nice.\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

They will be provided with one of several songs to create and will be able to remix it as they wish.\nThis workshop will cover the basics of Sonic Pi, including creation of notes, rhythms and introducing samples. As the software is free participants will be able to continue with their music and create new pieces at home if they wish. We will cover the importance of learning to code, and how coding music is one of the most fun ways to program your own projects.\n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nEvery person, or pair if they wish, will have a Raspberry Pi to work on. This will already be set up, along with Sonic Pi open and ready. Each participant will have a worksheet for their preferred piece of music but I would also be doing the same thing at the front. However, they can carry on faster if they would like, following the worksheet. At the end of the session we will make a big piece of music by combining aspects of everybody's work and ideas for each track. This will be our Magical Music remix of several popular songs, and can be shared online for participants and the public via Twitter and my website girls2geeks.com.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nHeadphones will be required for each participant to be connected to the Raspberry Pi's in the room, also the Pi's will need Sonic Pi pre-loaded.\nI will provide the worksheets for the musical code.\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

Web literacy isn’t just writing Python—it’s knowing how to wield a search engine, how to craft a strong password and when our online activities are being tracked. \r\n\r\nThrough hands-on workshops, participants will explore, make and play with the tools and technologies that form the fabric of the web. And through discussion and talks, we’ll invite our guests to reflect on, and improve, their relationship with the web. Our space will instill the skills and confidence in both young and old, students and teachers, to make the web a more vibrant, diverse ecosystem.\r\n",

It is also creating new risks as technology impacts human rights, equality, jobs, and consumer protection. Maximizing the opportunities at hand will require more “public interest technologists” pursuing the public good. Today we do not have enough of them.\n\nIn this session experts will lead a collaborative discussion with participants on how to build the community of technologists working in the public interest, and how to create career paths for their work.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThere are several goals for this session:\n1.   Exchange stories and best practices globally for engaging technologists in projects in the public interest.\n2.   Develop a set of actionable ideas for expanding the pool of public interest-oriented technologists, particularly at the university level.\n3.   Grow the international network of people interested in working in this area.\n\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nThe ability to project slides (a projector and screen) would be helpful, though not essential. \n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

We will discuss antitrust and competition principles at a high level, but focus on getting input from Mozfest participants to share their views on the state of competition from the field. Key questions: Does concentration make it harder for startup companies enter and compete? Are there practices that major platforms engage in that stifle competition or innovation? Have large platforms become gatekeepers that can dictate unfair or anticompetitive terms to users or competitors? What impact do large platforms have on innovation?\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe goal will be to get a broader perspective on the current highly debated antitrust and competition issues related to digital platforms with a broad cross section of Mozfest participants who have factual knowledge and views from the field and antitrust and competition experts.  Understanding and learning will be gained by fostering a conversation with varying views of the competitive landscape and how antitrust and competition law can and should be used to address potential concentration or competition concerns.\n\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nProjector for slides\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

Big tech corporations, select media companies and closed governments control the content on the Internet, the data that flows across the Internet and how people connect to the Internet. This dystopian future is closer than you may think.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, what is the utopian version of the Internet in 2027? What future do we want to build? Where do emerging technologies like AI, mesh networking and Blockchain fit in? How do we ensure people are the most important part of the Internet?\r\n\r\nJoin us at Mozfest as we look into the future.

Experts from those countries will lead a roundtable discussion on how policies were adopted, how they are different/similar, how they impact individuals, organizations, companies, government, whether they're working and whether there are efforts in other countries to adopt similar protections. The US representative(s) will provide an update on the Trump FCC’s proceeding to repeal the 2015 Open Internet rules; potential impact of the repeal; efforts to preserve them. The India representative will summarize rapid development of net neutrality policy - what's been unique to the Indian experience? Any insights for other jurisdictions?\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe goal of this session is to provide a comparative study of different Open Internet policies and to learn what has worked and what has not, both in the process for getting such policies adopted, but also in the policies themselves. What research/policy arguments were critical in convincing policymakers to adopt these policies?  What messaging was most compelling? How much did the policies of different countries influence the others - and relatedly, how did the legal framework around communication regulation in each country (for example, Title II in the US) customize the nature of the debate?  \n\n\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nThere may be a need for a projector, but likely nothing more than that. \n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

Not everyone knows how to install a VPN or use encryption—but everyone should feel safe online. Can we imagine a future where manufacturers respect our safety by default when they build products? Where governments take steps to protect us? Can we find fun, new ways to engage our friends and neighbours around these issues?\r\n\r\nAt Mozfest, we’ll build, teach and play with these new approaches to Privacy & Security.

Participants will discuss the consequences that such a proposal would have for law enforcement, national security, and the EU economy.\n\nThis conversation is designed to be a follow-on from a U.S. focused conversation in September 2017 -- taking the lessons learned from the U.S. conversation and scaling out to address the European and global impact that a legal mandate for encrypted devices would have.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nFollowing the session, I will publish a lessons learned document of the findings to educate UK and EU policy makers on the consequences of encryption legislation. The session is designed to build bridges between U.S. and EU privacy activists to harmonize international encryption strategy. It is also designed to balance the dialogue between the US and European governments and prevent reactionary policy making that targets a neutral and beneficial technology.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nCopies of U.S. lessons learned document.\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

Fighting shutdowns around school exams\n**[ Primary Space ]** Decentralization\n**[ Secondary Space ]** Digital Inclusion\n\n\n**[ Submitter's Name ]** Deji Bryce Olukotun\n**[ Submitter's Affiliated Organisation ]** Access Now\n\n\n**[ Additional facilitators ]** Islam Khoufi,,Moses Karanja,,\n\n\n### What will happen in your session?\nIn 2016 and 2017, we recorded more than 30 instances of intentional internet shutdowns during school exams in the MENA region and in countries as diverse as India, Congo Brazzaville, Ethiopia, and Tunisia. Many such shutdowns are nationwide internet blackouts, although they take different forms. This is a broader, international problem that is a key indicator of Internet Health. A problem that we can solve. \n\nAlgeria’s economy lost $20.5 million during an internet shutdown for school exams in June 2016. There is also the risk that governments will switch to jamming, filtering, or blocking technologies that violate the privacy of students, educators, and businesses. Worse, some governments may use school exams as a pretext to clamp down on free expression.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nWe'll aim to teach people about shutdowns around school exams and equip them with technical and pragmatic solutions to fight back. People will leave the session with practical information about circumvention tools, trends, and how to report this key indicator of internet health. We'll gather strategies from current students and activists from people who have experienced censorship. Importantly, we hope people in the Mozilla community will also offer technical solutions.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nWe may do a brief interactive session. We may display a jammer for a demonstration purposes if it does not impact other people at MozFest.\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

We’ll investigate the challenges to open production (misinformation, draconian copyright) and the values of open creativity (working open techniques, tools and tactical transparency). The space is programmed as a highly-interactive platform for producing and protecting the principles of the open web. Join us in evolving our epically-open online world.\r\n",

As a former investigative reporter I know that reporters can’t afford to write about private money in politics without the public records to back up their claims, because they can be sued for defamation and damages and be shut down if they do so. I will explain a project I'm working on in Texas that aggregates data with specificity so that journalists can easily use it worry-free and lawsuit-free.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nI hope people will see the need for specificity – which means online data tools that can give users the big-picture perspective and while also directing users back to the individual public records that were filed with government entities regarding campaign finance and lobbying money in state politics. I hope people will be inspired by the groups I am working with in Austin, Texas called INFLUENCE TX and Texans for Public Justice that have an online database tool that verifies its analysis with public records. I hope people will have and shares ideas about how we can spread this information to other groups and encourage tactical transparency and media integrity online.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\n\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

This session will share lessons from Access Now's collaboration with Lush, an ethical cosmetics company that makes its products from scratch and that does not pay for advertising. Together, we joined forces to amplify the #KeepitOn campaign to fight internet shutdowns (130 organizations; 56 countries) with a special bath product called an Error 404 bath bomb that raised over $200,000 to support grassroots digital rights organizations around the world. The money will be awarded to some 20 different organizations on the front lines of fighting for the open internet.\n\n\n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nWe’ll share important lessons from this exciting collaboration for activists, hackers, insights from Lush Digital Fund judges, and feedback from grant recipients. We’ll show how Lush and Access Now have upheld Mozilla’s commitment to the open internet and the ins and outs of working with activists. Participants will have an opportunity to grab their very own Error 404 bath bomb.\n\nThe goal is to introduce participants to new ways of collaborating to support the open internet. Participants will about ethical sourcing; private sector-non-profit collaborations; and the plague of internet shutdowns. We'll also share communications strategies and lessons from grantmaking. We'll also discuss projects like Fairphone, a sustainable smartphone company. (Fairphone's attendance TBC.)\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nWe may use a laptop to present a video. We would also likely bring special bath products and materials from Lush Digital Fund recipients.\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

In this session, we will discuss issues facing OA advocates around the world. Disconnecting people from scholarly research reduces the trust of people in institutions, reduces the impact of scholarly work, and creates artificial barriers to knowledge. Are language barriers, costs, access to infrastructure, and/or censorship impacting your community’s access to scholarship, education, and data? Do you want to learn more about OA around the world and connect with OA advocates? Please join Mozilla Science and SPARC (https://sparcopen.org/) for a round table discussion to celebrate global Open Access Week with conversation about access to research and scholarship in your community.\n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nOur goals is to meet people, hear about the barriers to Open Access in all institutions, communities, and parts of the world that face OA challenges. We want to surface innovative strategies from around the world and learn from the global community. We want to discuss what outreach strategies are impactful in different communities. We want to create a space to have conversation around inclusion, access, and equity in scholarship and academia.

In Station 1, participants will evaluate types of data tracking to make informed decisions about how their data is shared. In Station 2, participants will create a document of best practices around privacy and security to share with library staff, patrons, family and friends.  \n\nWe will bring both groups together to discuss ways in which we can work together toward staying safe on the web while maintaining a spirit of inclusion.  Our discussion will include tools and resources needed to become leaders in this space.\n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nUsing collective knowledge and given resources, participants will evaluate types of data tracking and create their own plan for best practices of online security. \n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nWe will need a projector, paper, pens, post-t notes, chart paper, markers and tape.  \n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

Because each neighborhood suffers from a variety of injustices, neither have the same technology needs. We needed a common ground, so we collaboratively built a set of shared working principles. In this session, EII organizers will share the methods and lessons learned in building and practicing these principles. Participants will understand the multiple ways these principles can look in practice and walk away with a clear process on how to collaboratively create a set of shared principles themselves. \n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nIf you are not working toward equality when building and using technology you are exacerbating the problems of inequality.  The goal of this session is to offer a principled framework for technologist that are interested in working collaboratively towards equality while respecting the individual issues of each community and end user. Our goal is to teach our participatory facilitation methods so participants can go on to build principles within their communities while offering a variety of examples of what principles can look like in practice. As a big picture we see this as an opportunity to cultivate more responsible, collaborative and community centered technologist. \n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nProjector\nMac Adapter\nPens\nPaper\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

We need to consider what we sow as well as what, and how much, we consume. \r\n\r\nIn the Web Literacy space, we’ll dig into the skills that help us read, write and participate on the web in a way that enriches both it and ourselves. Web literacy isn’t just writing Python—it’s knowing how to wield a search engine, how to craft a strong password and when our online activities are being tracked. \r\n\r\nThrough hands-on workshops, participants will explore, make and play with the tools and technologies that form the fabric of the web. And through discussion and talks, we’ll invite our guests to reflect on, and improve, their relationship with the web. Our space will instill the skills and confidence in both young and old, students and teachers, to make the web a more vibrant, diverse ecosystem.\r\n",

The Arduino-based toolkit has a variety of sensors (e.g., temperature, acceleration, pulse rate) and actuators (e.g., LEDs), as well as Bluetooth to play around with. Participants can make, for example simple sensor-based animations, visualise their personal health data, or even create complex wireless systems. This would work best as a drop-in session, for example for a few hours on one day of the festival, where people can stay as long as they like. A variety of printed tutorials will be provided to suit all experience levels -- from kids who have never programmed before, to IoT experts.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe rise of the IoT calls for more practical skills with hardware, especially programming microcontrollers, understanding sensor data and having a working knowledge of wireless transmission. This session will aim to help participants develop a working knowledge of these topics through hands-on exploration. It would also be great to exhibit the most interesting/fun creations made by the participants at the demo fair at the end of the festival. \n\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nTables, chairs, power supply\n\n\n### Time needed\nAll weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session\n",

Knowing how to design and make with these tools opens up a whole new world of making and problem solving. At STEAMLabs, we have introduced this to over 20,000 participants from drop-in sessions to multi-day programs. Digital fabrication tools have never been more affordable, but they still remain out of reach for many. In this session, we'll share some of the activities we've developed for using low cost equipment such as vinyl cutters and low cost 3D printers coupled with free and open source software. During the hands-on portion, try your hand at designing and making a precision-cut light up LED lantern.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nParticipants will come away with knowledge on what low cost digital fabrication equipment to purchase, and how to use it. A discussion portion of the session will allow us to give advice for each participant's organization.\n\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nI'll need a projector, a reliable Internet connection, preferably Ethernet.\n\nI'll bring all the other technology and materials.\n\nIf you want to run the activity all weekend as a drop-in, we'll need about $100 for materials budget.\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

We need to consider what we sow as well as what, and how much, we consume. \r\n\r\nIn the Web Literacy space, we’ll dig into the skills that help us read, write and participate on the web in a way that enriches both it and ourselves. Web literacy isn’t just writing Python—it’s knowing how to wield a search engine, how to craft a strong password and when our online activities are being tracked. \r\n\r\nThrough hands-on workshops, participants will explore, make and play with the tools and technologies that form the fabric of the web. And through discussion and talks, we’ll invite our guests to reflect on, and improve, their relationship with the web. Our space will instill the skills and confidence in both young and old, students and teachers, to make the web a more vibrant, diverse ecosystem.\r\n",

We would share our story of how we have been effective in providing Transformative/life-changing career opportunities to our students. We will show different aspects of CAFFE’s model for reaching Street Children and other Underprivileged minority groups. Participants will be able to get hands-on with a variety of our students’ creations as well as hear from former students about how CAFFE impacted their lives.\n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nDiscussion of issues, barriers and good practice. A look at the future and how we can work to maximise capacity building of grass roots community groups in Bangladesh and other developing countries. CAFFE not only operates its own school, we have also worked with other partners around the country to support them in delivering an IT curriculum that meets their needs. We would be very happy to share our successes and failures, when attempting to do this in a country where both Internet and electricity supply can be unreliable.\n\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nProjector, large screen TV, while we have a couple of our own laptops, any additional laptops that could be provided would allow more people to get hands on with our exhibits. (we are limited as to what we can bring as our equipment is in constant use at our school and it would have to be transported from Bangladesh)\n\n\n### Time needed\nAll weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session\n",

How can we go from inspiration to ideas quickly to improve lives and wellbeing? Chemo therapy can take anywhere from 3 to 8 hours and may have to happen several days a week. What happens if we use VR and 360 degree cameras to give people an escape? How might we engage surrogates to explore on the behalf of patients to give them an opportunity to move beyond the walls of the hospital? What other opportunities does VR offer in a hospital setting? There may also be, depending on timezone differential, the opportunity to include patient participants via VR. \n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe goal of this session is to inspire discussion around human-centered uses of emerging technology. In particular, our use of VR was designed only after deeply understanding the needs, hopes, fears and goals of patients going through chemotherapy treatment. We would like to explore with tech innovators how to work in service of the needs of people, their health and wellbeing. We would like to leave the session with some ideation —from practical to wild —on how patients can inspire the use of emerging technology like VR. \n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nWe will need internet connectivity and power and a projector - we can bring anything else we'd need from there. \n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

State-sponsored surveillance, theft of personal information, trolls arrogantly abusing others—this has become normal. And every day, many of us trade personal information for convenience.\r\n\r\nIt’s time to flip the script. Not everyone knows how to install a VPN or use encryption—but everyone should feel safe online. Can we imagine a future where manufacturers respect our safety by default when they build products? Where governments take steps to protect us? Can we find fun, new ways to engage our friends and neighbours around these issues?\r\n\r\nAt Mozfest, we’ll build, teach and play with these new approaches to Privacy & Security. Let’s put safety first.\r\n",

In the space we will be “taking the temperature” of MozFest by asking them to fill out quick surveys on how they feel about the big five issues, possibly as an entry and exit survey to gauge temperature before and after.\n\nWe are planning to have a big mailbox for survey submissions (we’re thinking a cage with robotic mice) and couple of rollup banners with basic facts and data on the five issues.\n\nThis proposal is meant as a placeholder so that we can expand on it with potential collaborators and further iterations on the ideas. \n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe goal is to playfully engage MozFest participants and get a picture of how people perceive the state of the Internet and how/if MozFest can influence that. Our ambition would be to release the results of the survey to press before the end of MozFest.\n\n\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nWe might need help with the production of roll-ups, I will update this section as we clarify the format in more detail.\n\n\n\n### Time needed\nAll weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session\n",

Programs refer to workshops for growing the ability sets of people with none or limited digital skills. To narrow the scope, we will start the open discussion using cases that have involved, as key element, experimentation with open technology in the public space people inhabit. Ideation techniques will be used.\n\nFramework, not recipes or ‘best practices’, because building effective learning in vulnerable communities is a complex task and cannot be tackled with best practices that ignore the relevance of context.\n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe goal is to build a first iteration of a framework, understood as a guiding set of principles for the ‘how to’ develop context-aware and context-relevant curriculums for web literacy programs. \n\nOne outcome is to have participants drawing from their experience of success and failure in learning/teaching new skills in different contexts. What has worked and what not when building curriculums for diverse groups or when trying to leverage local knowledge to decide on content? What parts of the process can and cannot be replicable? What pitfalls to avoid? How to assess what’s manageable in each context? Should context be a tool for enhancing the learning? My purpose is that participants leave feeling eager to keep collaborating on this framework.\n\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nA laptop, a projector, and a a reliable internet connection to run the session remotely if needed. Paper, pens, post it notes. \n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

Our young people's group will select and work with a digital craft maker/innovator to co-produce and deliver a drop-in interactive session. \n\nMake:Shift:Do takes place in makerspaces, fablabs, galleries, libraries, and community centres across the UK. We'd like to bring Mozfest into the heart of this network, livestreaming Make:Shift:Do events happening all over the UK and encouraging our Make:Shift:Do venues to openly share their activities online.\n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nWe'd like to invite Mozfest attendees to explore cutting-edge approaches to making, changing perceptions of the meaning of ‘craft’ and revealing its real world potential. \n\nMake:Shift:Do celebrates the power of open source technology, shared makerspaces, and new tools, such as affordable 3D printers and digital knitting machines, to open new possibilities for everyday makers. The workshop will invite participants to consider how open access to these technologies can drive innovation and create solutions to wellbeing issues.  \n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nCrafts Council should be able to supply all materials. It would be great if there was a projector and big screen we could use to livestream Make:Shift:Do events from around the country. \n\n\n### Time needed\nAll weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session\n",

We’ll investigate the challenges to open production (misinformation, draconian copyright) and the values of open creativity (working open techniques, tools and tactical transparency).

This question seems to be abstractive, therefore we want to start from storytelling. Participants will be invited to take part in a test that will help them chose which of four roles towards copyright they represent (guardians,creators, unsuspecting users and rebels - we identified them through a study of European teachers). \n\nAfterwards they will be encouraged to share their copyright stories - we want to record these testimonies and use in policy work. Then we will highlight current EU copyright reform. We will end every conversation with “call to action” and some easy and handy tools and ideas how  participants can make difference. \n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe main goal of our session is to convince participants of Mozfest that copyright matters for them and they should take action to create user friendly copyright framework. Our drop-in session will be highly interactive and informative since we want to raise awareness and motivate people to take actions. \nThe outcome of the session will be a movie with testimonies of participants regarding their copyright experiences. Communia as an organization working in the field of public policy keeps looking for new ways of communication and narration and this “movie-experiment” will be very helpful for our organization and our work regarding copyright reform. \n\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nTable, flipchart, extension block  \n\n\n### Time needed\nAll weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session\n",

During this workshop I want to share and learn from experiences about teaching R, and collaboratively build a new “fun intro to R course”. The idea is to build an introductory course that is friendly and efficient in teaching R for those without computer science background and, at the same time, is fun, attractive and filled with unorthodox examples. We will use unexpected data-sets drawn from pop culture, music, literature and so on, balancing real R usage with light-hearted data in a way that will help learning R to be an attractive activity.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nAs an outcome we should get a complete course: slides, scripts, guides, data and everything that will help an instructor to use and/or modify the material to teach an R course. The goal is to facilitate the activities of those interested in teaching R and spreading open source and open research practices among students. In my experience, dealing mostly with Biological Sciences students in Brazil, most students without programming skills believe that R is a very difficult tool to master, and are usually scared of it. Combining a good teaching planning with unusual and fun examples can help overcome this.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nA projector and a whiteboard will do the job.\n\n\n### Time needed\nAll weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session\n",

Web literacy isn’t just writing Python—it’s knowing how to wield a search engine, how to craft a strong password and when our online activities are being tracked. \r\n\r\nThrough hands-on workshops, participants will explore, make and play with the tools and technologies that form the fabric of the web. And through discussion and talks, we’ll invite our guests to reflect on, and improve, their relationship with the web. Our space will instill the skills and confidence in both young and old, students and teachers, to make the web a more vibrant, diverse ecosystem.\r\n",

PWAs are regular mobile and desktop web applications that are accessible in any web browser. In browsers that support the relevant standards, they provide additional capabilities such as offline support, Add To Homescreen icons and push notifications. We would start from a basic website template and step-by-step add features (via Progressive Enhancement) to turn it into a PWA. For those who have a laptop, they would be encouraged to code along, or modify their own site. For those without a laptop, we would encourage them if possible to team up with someone who does (otherwise they could follow along and help with ours).\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nWe would like to help demystify PWAs and create one together with the participants. The 'PWA' term can be confusing and it can be hard to know how to get started. By the end of this session, we hope that all participants will, at the least, have made a web app that they can save to a mobile homescreen and load offline in a supported browser. For participants who advance quickly, we could introduce additional features such as push notifications. We would also cover best practices for web apps such as responsive design (PWAs are not just for mobile devices). Plus answer questions and provide general support.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nA large screen or projector would be ideal, so we can show code as we are going along.\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

State-sponsored surveillance, theft of personal information, trolls arrogantly abusing others—this has become normal. And every day, many of us trade personal information for convenience.\r\n\r\nIt’s time to flip the script. Not everyone knows how to install a VPN or use encryption—but everyone should feel safe online. Can we imagine a future where manufacturers respect our safety by default when they build products? Where governments take steps to protect us? Can we find fun, new ways to engage our friends and neighbours around these issues?\r\n\r\nAt Mozfest, we’ll build, teach and play with these new approaches to Privacy & Security. Let’s put safety first.\r\n",

In August 2016,  the European Regulators (BEREC) agreed on a common interpretation of the legal texts. However, a year later, the landscape of enforcement of these new rules is diverse. In the 31 countries where the new regulation applies, telecoms regulators have dealt with net neutrality violations in different ways, and as a consequence a comparison of net neutrality enforcement practices proves interesting. BEREC is also in the process of developing a net neutrality assessment methodology. On the basis of this methodological framework, the national regulators will develop measurement software to detect net neutrality violations and measure Internet QoS.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nIn this session we would like to provide an understanding of the current state of play in net neutrality in Europe. We would also like to provide insight into the work of digital rights NGOs in making sure that the new net neutrality provisions are enforced -- by evaluating new products, measuring services in order to detect violations, engaging in public advocacy and submitting complaints to regulators. \nThis session could also be combined with other net neutrality submissions in order to generate a broader debate. \n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nA projector and (potentially) loudspeakers would be required for the presentation. \n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

How can we present this information to senior researchers, who may be less experienced with these tools, so they can promote open research practices to their students and research teams? The next 40 minutes will be spent compiling these resources in a collaborative Etherpad and organising/documenting them within a GitHub repository/webpage.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nMany scientific fields are still dominated by closed research practices. It is often difficult to reproduce results and frustrating to build/iterate on the research of others. The reasons for this are diverse, but one prominent issue is a lack of understanding about HOW to work in an open way. The goal of this session is to compile an Open Science Resource Kit general enough for anyone to use, contribute to or adapt. Ideally, it will be pitched at senior researchers so they are best equipped to encourage early career scientists to work openly - in order to successfully mentor the next generation of open science practitioners we also need to target those who advise them.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nThis session does not require additional materials beyond a projector and office supplies (paper, pens, post-it notes).\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

Also, the data indicated that the most responsive chatters are women. \n Participants in the session will discuss their encounters with any chat- bot like platform. They can describe why they liked/didn’t like it; why they were having a conversation with the chatbot etc. \nWhile providing the descriptions of their experiences with chatbots, participants will engage in a bingo game that will involve them picking sides of which environments they feel comfortable in while learning.  \nAdditional resource;research on gendering chatbots(http://bit.ly/2hj4cwS)\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nOne of outcomes is to have a collection of ideas (and execution) on how to enhance chatting and learning (the type elected to be safe) for women in targeted spaces on the Web.\nAnother goal is to identify methods (qualitative and quantitative) to measure improvement in inclusion and safety in targeted spaces.\n\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nPost it notes and manilla papers\n\n\n### Time needed\nless than 60 mins\n",

State-sponsored surveillance, theft of personal information, trolls arrogantly abusing others—this has become normal. And every day, many of us trade personal information for convenience.\r\n\r\nIt’s time to flip the script. Not everyone knows how to install a VPN or use encryption—but everyone should feel safe online. Can we imagine a future where manufacturers respect our safety by default when they build products? Where governments take steps to protect us? Can we find fun, new ways to engage our friends and neighbours around these issues?\r\n\r\nAt Mozfest, we’ll build, teach and play with these new approaches to Privacy & Security. Let’s put safety first.\r\n",

It uses the micro:bit’s radio signal to detect the distance between the parent and child. The parent’s bit:badge starts to flash when the child goes out of the set range. The child’s bit:badge  also starts to flash and shows a mobile number so any adult with a mobile phone can contact the parent.\nWe will teach the code required to run the bit:badge and raise awareness about some of the differences between life in the UK and Bangladesh.\n\nThe Bit:badge should just be used as a sample project.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nParticipants will be taught how to use the micro:bit’s radio function as well as how to show symbols and text. If statements, variables and loops are all required to code the bit:badge. We will also introduce the idea of creating wearables using either a watch strap that holds the micro:bit or pinning the micro:bit on like a badge.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nAdditional requirements: We will need laptops/Pi Tops or PC to access the Micro:Bit website. \n\nFemi will arrange loan of Micro:Bits through Code Club and CAS.\n\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

A good outcome would be to connect blockchain developers to researchers working on these problems.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nIf anticipated to be a popular session, a PA and mic system would be useful.

The space will be centred around a ‘wish tree’, where project leads can post their project, and interested collaborators can add their names and comments. The installation would include a seating area to act as a meeting space for collaborators to talk during the event. \nIn this space, we could host an ‘open mic’ soapbox session for project leads to describe their project and pitch for contributors (one-minute lightning pitches), potentially over Sunday lunch.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe ultimate goal is to foster collaboration and spark new ideas for open-source open-science projects. I hope this would lead to more contributions, streamline some efforts (where people are working separately on the same problem/idea) and bootstrap some projects.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nBeanbags would be awesome, thanks!\nA ‘wish tree’ - something sturdy on which we can attach/hang ~30 wish cards. I could help make beforehand, and have some ideas as to how (wire coathangers?)\nWish cards, and ‘contributor’ leaves - probably something sturdier than post-its, perhaps wooden votives with clips to attach paper ‘leaves’ to? Again, I can help with this.\nPens and stickers to write on and decorate the cards and leaves.\nI can bring a laptop to help with digitally documenting the wish tree, but would appreciate Mozilla help here too.\nFor the pitching session, would we need a mic? A soapbox to stand on would be cool. Plus a hooter to keep pitchers to time.\n\n\n### Time needed\nAll weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session\n",

Participants will be using JavaScript to doodle in the web browser.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nTo gain more experience with the HTML Canvas and JavaScript for drawing. To successfully create a doodle - either static or animated. To show that every piece of code doesn't have to be perfect, and that you don't have to start out with a plan in mind. You can just edit it and experiment on the fly.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nI will require computers with a programming IDE and a web browser. One computer per participant. Perhaps a USB stick so they can take their code home.\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

Big tech corporations, select media companies and closed governments control the content on the Internet, the data that flows across the Internet and how people connect to the Internet. This dystopian future is closer than you may think.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, what is the utopian version of the Internet in 2027? What future do we want to build? Where do emerging technologies like AI, mesh networking and Blockchain fit in? How do we ensure people are the most important part of the Internet?\r\n\r\nJoin us at Mozfest as we look into the future.

This takes a photo, processes the photo by taking each pixel colour value and drawing RGB squares from it, and then prints out the photo. The booth is placed in front of a stool - the stool we used at the science festival broke so I think we will need to source another one. The booth is controlled by a foot pedal, photos can be retaken as many times as required before printing. I have it set up so its easy to change the theme of the UI so I can make a mozfest themed one.\n\nPhotos here:\nhttps://twitter.com/MiniGirlGeek/status/784079594861293568\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nTeach people that you can make lots of colours using just red green and blue light and that this is how screens work. They will be able to take home a photo of themselves with each pixel decomposed.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nI have all the electrical equipment required, although paper and ink will be required. Additionally I cannot transport the photo booth myself - it's quite heavy and bulky.\n\n\n### Time needed\nAll weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session\n",

Given the stress placed on cotton farmers in developing countries, development of these new fibres will help distribute demand over a larger group of farmers and thus create income for many more farmers. In textiles, these new fibres can also empower artisans who work on handlooms to create newer products that meet the needs of our world and its needs for environment friendly options. The overall objective is to introduce participants to innovative models being created at the grassroots, which are based onc rcular economy.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nWe will need a projector, screen, power cord and stationery supplies such as drawing sheets, sketch pens and post-its.\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

Today, tech companies are in a quest of global domination, penetrating every government, computing every citizen movement, mediating every act of any connected person’s life. Beyond privacy and security, the alarming tension whose emergence we are witnessing is the one between control and freedom, not only of the individual, but of entire populations and regions. Some criticise it as a form of “digital colonialism”, others defend it as progress, indicating that those companies provide better services than corrupt governments. The debate is heating up and we want to have a smart conversation about it. \n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nStart a discussion on whether  and connect the sociological and political importance of free software, decentralised technologies, ethical frames for data, web literacy and autonomous, decentralised solutions to tackle colonial efforts, resulting in freedom and dignity for people. Discuss whether \"digital colonialism\" is a good term to describe the current phenomenon of power concentration and growth strategies of technology companies. \n\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

State-sponsored surveillance, theft of personal information, trolls arrogantly abusing others—this has become normal. And every day, many of us trade personal information for convenience.\r\n\r\nIt’s time to flip the script. Not everyone knows how to install a VPN or use encryption—but everyone should feel safe online. Can we imagine a future where manufacturers respect our safety by default when they build products? Where governments take steps to protect us? Can we find fun, new ways to engage our friends and neighbours around these issues?\r\n\r\nAt Mozfest, we’ll build, teach and play with these new approaches to Privacy & Security. Let’s put safety first.\r\n",

How can we ensure this transition strengthens freedom of expression and free and fair elections in the South, where elections are still fragile? And, how can digital tools help nurture rather than undermine electoral processes?  How relevant is privacy and literacy when you are participating in elections?  Our session will discuss a mix of soft and hard regulations for online political advertising, and complimentary online privacy protections for voters with concrete examples of recent political processes and emerging regulation North and South. \r\n\r\n\r\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\r\nOur attendees will understand better the emerging challenges and opportunities that the Internet offers during elections. We will have a conversation around three different concerns: (1) the impact of politically-targeted advertising and its vendors; (2) The digital gap of those lacking the literacy to follow electoral campaigns online; and (3) why data privacy matters for voters? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\r\nWe do not need.

We need to consider what we sow as well as what, and how much, we consume. \r\n\r\nIn the Web Literacy space, we’ll dig into the skills that help us read, write and participate on the web in a way that enriches both it and ourselves. Web literacy isn’t just writing Python—it’s knowing how to wield a search engine, how to craft a strong password and when our online activities are being tracked. \r\n\r\nThrough hands-on workshops, participants will explore, make and play with the tools and technologies that form the fabric of the web. And through discussion and talks, we’ll invite our guests to reflect on, and improve, their relationship with the web. Our space will instill the skills and confidence in both young and old, students and teachers, to make the web a more vibrant, diverse ecosystem.\r\n",

I have spoken with Emrys Green from Arts Award and he has suggested this should come under Web Literacy but as part of the youth led strand.\n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThis session will be an introduction to both Scratch and HTML. Those new to Scratch will discover a new and highly accessible gateway to learning code. Those new to HTML will discover an easy to use HTML simulator that will allow them to experiment >> understand >> produce code that can be copied and pasted to create a real html webpage by the end of the session.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nOur session requires 15 laptops (should be able to cover ourselves)\nElectricity\nProjector\nSmall sound system\nTables, chairs\nInternet access\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

This dystopian future is closer than you may think.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, what is the utopian version of the Internet in 2027? What future do we want to build? Where do emerging technologies like AI, mesh networking and Blockchain fit in? How do we ensure people are the most important part of the Internet?\r\n\r\nJoin us at Mozfest as we look into the future. Dystopian, utopian or somewhere in between—let’s explore the Internet of 2027.\r\n\r\nSubmit a proposal now - https://mozillafestival.org/spaces#Decentralization\r\n\r\n",

After the context is set, we’ll dive into the hands-on workshop (https://goo.gl/5GgEg3).\n\n- Setup development environment - Install testrpc, web3js and start test blockchain\n- Smart contracts: Use solidity (an objected-oriented programming language) to write out a simple contract that increments votes and returns the count of votes\n- Setup a simple website to invoke the contract methods\n- Play with the application and see blockchain in live\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe aim of the workshop is to ensure that participants are aware of the entire ethereum stack and by themselves - able to compile, deploy and interact with the application. Participants are made aware about blockchain - a decentralized database that is used to make sure that transactions are immutable and helps build trust among its users. At the end of the workshop, the participants would’ve built their first decentralized voting application using the ethereum framework on the blockchain. \n\nThe larger goal is to help participants to appreciate decentralization as a philosophy and  the concept of trust over the internet to build applications on their own or contribute to the plethora of open source Ðapps listed here (https://dapps.ethercasts.com/).\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nWe would need a few sheets of paper and pens to put down Ethereum's architecture on paper. This would help participants understand the concepts better.\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

Web literacy isn’t just writing Python—it’s knowing how to wield a search engine, how to craft a strong password and when our online activities are being tracked. \r\n\r\nThrough hands-on workshops, participants will explore, make and play with the tools and technologies that form the fabric of the web. And through discussion and talks, we’ll invite our guests to reflect on, and improve, their relationship with the web.

I'm interested in developing this around the concepts in the internet health report and on issues and rules that we see in tech policy. At MozFest, I would love to be able to workshop the game itself -- develop the rules, characters and conditions cards, and potentially get to a point of play-testing the game. Participants could focus on game play, card design, rule development or other game features.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nCard, rules, characters and conditions for the in development game on tech policy. If we're super productive, then potentially a few rounds of play testing. Additionally participants could work on artwork for the cards, leaving space for everyone to participate in the process.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nPaper, pens and post-its would be extremely useful for this session.\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

State-sponsored surveillance, theft of personal information, trolls arrogantly abusing others—this has become normal. And every day, many of us trade personal information for convenience.\r\n\r\nIt’s time to flip the script. Not everyone knows how to install a VPN or use encryption—but everyone should feel safe online. Can we imagine a future where manufacturers respect our safety by default when they build products? Where governments take steps to protect us? Can we find fun, new ways to engage our friends and neighbours around these issues?\r\n\r\nAt Mozfest, we’ll build, teach and play with these new approaches to Privacy & Security. Let’s put safety first.\r\n",

It then predicts various personality traits based on that data.\n\nThis installation presents one user’s results as a time-based data visualization. The projection on translucent material addresses on one hand the ‘glassy’ consumer and the transparent person, but also on the other hand the lack of information transparency.\n\nVisual examples: http://dataselfie.it/installation\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nInternet users create different identities on the different platforms. They control how they want to be seen. Data Selfie addresses the data profiles created about them by machines at Facebook, Google and Co. – the only profiles they never get to see, but unconsciously create.\nThis project aims to provide a personal perspective on data mining, predictive analytics and our online data identity – including inferred information from our consumption. In our data society algorithms are omnipresent and seemingly omniscient.\nOne thing is certain, Big Data algorithms increasingly define our lives. Therefore, it is important – especially for those who are indifferent to this issue – to be aware of the power and influence of our data on ourselves. \n \n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nA technical diagram can be found at http://dataselfie.it/installation. If space is not sufficient there might be an alternative setup that requires less.\n\nSince this is a projection a darkened area would be best.\n\n\n### Time needed\nAll weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session\n",

The idea is to base this exercise, on the work that other people have done in their countries. In particular, we will use the methodology used by Artigo 19 in Brazil. For the session, the participants will: \n- Choose a topic that it is important for their work: Violence, Crime, Women’s Rights, are topics that will be encouraged. \n- Go to their country’s Data\n- Rate data based on  Technical and Thematic indicators \n- Research International indicators \n- Produce a one-pager of the evaluation of data on that topic \n- Publish one-pager and put it available for the government and thematic institutions \n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nTwo main physical outcomes: \n- A focal assessment on Open Data that will help on demanding more and better Open Data \n- Assistants have the opportunity to focalized and utilized a Community driven Open Data methodology, instead of a broad method. \n\nPromote better ways to demand and create Data. In the last couple of years, we have been occupied with creating a Data Pipeline, this Data Pipeline is technical and structural. It is a sorrow to admit that our efforts have been at best insufficient for the Open Data social demands. Therefore we need better methods, our attempt with this session is create the new iteration of Open Data demands. \n\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nPost-its, dashboard and projector. \n\n\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

A variety of resources to help people experiencing homelessness are available online, ranging from searchable databases of services to applications for financial assistance. How do individuals who are homeless access the internet? What devices and tools are most helpful?\n\nSession participants will interactively learn how people in homelessness access the internet and which free, sometimes surprising, online tools are useful in connecting them to housing and the broader community. Participants also will have an opportunity to experience accessing commonly-needed services on various internet-enabled devices within the time limitations sometimes imposed on usage for those living in homelessness.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe goal is to help participants realize what simple, real-world digital solutions make a difference in the lives of people who are homelessness, based on my 14 years experiencing in working with homeless families. Session participants will walk away with an increased understanding of digital challenges faced by people experiencing homelessness and fresh ideas on how common online apps and social media platforms can effectively be used by people experiencing homelessness. \n\nThroughout this interactive session, participants will have the opportunity to try their hand at searching and applying for housing resources under time constraints and to share their suggestions of yet unexplored online apps and tools that may be beneficial to people living on the street or in homeless shelters.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nA projector to share slides and a white board or flip chart are needed.

State-sponsored surveillance, theft of personal information, trolls arrogantly abusing others—this has become normal. And every day, many of us trade personal information for convenience.\r\n\r\nIt’s time to flip the script. Not everyone knows how to install a VPN or use encryption—but everyone should feel safe online. Can we imagine a future where manufacturers respect our safety by default when they build products? Where governments take steps to protect us? Can we find fun, new ways to engage our friends and neighbours around these issues?\r\n\r\nAt Mozfest, we’ll build, teach and play with these new approaches to Privacy & Security. Let’s put safety first.\r\n",

Although universally applicable, we will examine privacy and security through the lens of organizations that provide educational and safe spaces to youth.\n\nLeveraging MozFest participant’s global perspective and expertise we examine these questions:\na.) How do privacy and security concerns vary across a global community?\nb.) What current risks keep organizational leaders up at night?\nc.) What resources and training would benefit these organizations?\nd.) What should training include to be relevant?\n\nThe session incorporates interactive scenarios and connects them to specific practices that improve privacy and security by focusing on practical human-centered steps organizations can implement.\n\n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe goal of this session is to:\n•\tfoster a dialogue and gather expertise from the global community about the current resources and best practices for privacy and security;\n•\tuncover insights on international issues and universal concerns for privacy and security;\n•\tcrowd-source content and approaches to help in the development of a privacy and security training program for organizational leaders;\n•\tdocument barriers and issues that need to be addressed to improve practice; and\n•\tdefine clear next steps for implementation and monitoring of privacy and security in order to improve compliance and best practice.\n\nThe outcomes of these discussions and the training materials will be shared so that all participants can benefit from the collective brainpower in the session.\n\n\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nOur session will require chart paper (if available), markers, post-it notes and colored dot stickers (for real time voting and prioritization of ideas).\n\nWe will bring any handouts or other resources that are not accessible via the etherpad.\n\nBecause one of the goals of this session is to emphasize that privacy and security concerns are best addressed via both technical and non-technical means, we are intentionally emphasizing both low-tech and more explicitly technical approaches that make an impact on improving privacy and security practice regardless of organizational resources or budgets.\n\n\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

By defining the key ideas, feelings, and actions that these issues embody, participants will then explore possibilities for collaborative storytelling through tabletop gaming tools like remixable gaming systems and through producing digital interactive fiction. Participants will then work to produce a set of games and narratives about exploring, experiencing, and playing concepts of privacy and security. By the end of this session, attendees will have a self-created product, a deeper understanding of internet health, and a set of ludic practices to engage in play and production for future teaching, publication, and dialogue. \n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nAt the end of this session, participants will have played through role-playing narratives that illustrate how to embody internet health practices. Further, they will have authored their own stories—either collectively through designing and play-testing a role-playing game or individually through writing an interactive fiction narrative. These texts will be shared both with other participants in the session and online for the general public. All materials created will be available for others to read, remix, and share after the session ends. By discussing, playing, and producing games and interactive texts, participants will develop key habits and routines related to internet safety and ways to share these practices with other audiences. \n\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nn/a\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

This is an introduction to how police collect data from citizens through surveillance equipment. Session will discuss how to analyze open records and surveillance data.\n\nParticipants will discuss real case studies, like recent case of ACLU obtaining social media data collected by police to track activists online.  Participants will work in small groups to develop a community solution to current surveillance tactics. Workshop is intended for both non-technical and technical solutions for fixing bias data collected from predictive policing practices. \n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nParticipants will learn how to use dataset as a storytelling tool. We want to transform spreadsheets and police records into human stories. Law enforcement agencies are using flawed data as the basis for their algorithmic equations, calculations that are determining who gets arrested or go to prison in America. \n\nOur session will provide participants with 1) increase understanding of surveillance technology is used within neighborhoods across the United States and online, 2) examples of community efforts to combat invasive law enforcement tactics through legislation and advocacy, and 3) tools for documenting and organizing against surveillance and predictive policing practices that encroach our civil liberties, human rights, and Internet privacy. \n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nProjector, Markerboard/markers.\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

We will explore some examples along with personal experiences about teaching using games (for e.g. I created a [\"get you feet wet with JavaScript\" tutorial with Pacman](https://thimbleprojects.org/gideonthomas/202506/) for a group of students entering their first year for a degree in computer studies) and what appeals to different age groups.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nAttendees learn from each other's experiences and perspectives about teaching web technologies using games and will hopefully incorporate that when creating curriculum.\n\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nFor the presenter:\n- A projector\n- A whiteboard\n\nFor the attendees:\n- Post-its\n- Pens/markers\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

State-sponsored surveillance, theft of personal information, trolls arrogantly abusing others—this has become normal. And every day, many of us trade personal information for convenience.\r\n\r\nIt’s time to flip the script. Not everyone knows how to install a VPN or use encryption—but everyone should feel safe online. Can we imagine a future where manufacturers respect our safety by default when they build products? Where governments take steps to protect us? Can we find fun, new ways to engage our friends and neighbours around these issues?\r\n\r\nAt Mozfest, we’ll build, teach and play with these new approaches to Privacy & Security. Let’s put safety first.\r\n",

Big tech corporations, select media companies and closed governments control the content on the Internet, the data that flows across the Internet and how people connect to the Internet. This dystopian future is closer than you may think.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, what is the utopian version of the Internet in 2027? What future do we want to build? Where do emerging technologies like AI, mesh networking and Blockchain fit in? How do we ensure people are the most important part of the Internet?\r\n\r\nJoin us at Mozfest as we look into the future. Dystopian, utopian or somewhere in between—let’s explore the Internet of 2027.\r\n\r\nSubmit a proposal now - https://mozillafestival.org/spaces#Decentralization\r\n\r\n",

I will ask participants to contribute as to what else can be brought to the public and how. We shall traverse obstacles of reclaiming public space and discuss new ways of utilizing it other than protests and graffiti. \n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe session will attempt to understand the importance of utilizing public space and why it seems to be so carefully guarded by the state. Conventional methods such as television and radio operate either under rules of censorship or rules of profit making and corporate and political interests. It is important to find new ways of bypassing this sort of bias. But just like the Egyptian experience of bringing information out to the open using public space as a medium, perhaps more can be delivered such as skills and tools as well as a different perspective, particularly to people whose physical spaces deter them for accessing the virtual spaces we all do on the internet.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\n- Speakers\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

Big tech corporations, select media companies and closed governments control the content on the Internet, the data that flows across the Internet and how people connect to the Internet. This dystopian future is closer than you may think.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, what is the utopian version of the Internet in 2027? What future do we want to build? Where do emerging technologies like AI, mesh networking and Blockchain fit in? How do we ensure people are the most important part of the Internet?\r\n\r\nJoin us at Mozfest as we look into the future.

First, under black-box conditions where only algorithm decision information is known. Second when information about the decision criteria of each algorithm are given. \nWe will then proceed to discuss a number of case studies related with.\n-\tThe role of recommender algorithms in hoaxes and fake news on the Web\n-\tUnintended algorithmic discrimination on the web – routes towards detection and prevention\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThis session is part of the public engagement work for the UnBias project (http://unbias.wp.horizon.ac.uk) aimed at developing design-, regulation- and education- recommendations to minimize unjustified and inappropriate bias in algorithmic services. It will build on our previous experience of running workshops with youths (12-17 years old), with our stakeholders group of industry, civil-society, regulators, academics and teachers, and at academic conferences.\nThe goal of the session is to gain insights into the knowledge, perceptions and concerns of people regarding algorithms that intermediate between internet users and online information. These will contribute to the development of our algorithm awareness, empowerment and empathy tool-kits, our submissions to parliamentary inquiries and our work on the IEEE P7003 Standard for Algorithm Bias Considerations.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nOverhead projector could be useful, but is not essential.\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

State-sponsored surveillance, theft of personal information, trolls arrogantly abusing others—this has become normal. And every day, many of us trade personal information for convenience.\r\n\r\nIt’s time to flip the script. Not everyone knows how to install a VPN or use encryption—but everyone should feel safe online. Can we imagine a future where manufacturers respect our safety by default when they build products? Where governments take steps to protect us? Can we find fun, new ways to engage our friends and neighbours around these issues?\r\n\r\nAt Mozfest, we’ll build, teach and play with these new approaches to Privacy & Security. Let’s put safety first.\r\n",

Usually, people start off with an amount of money. In my game, however, people enter the game with no money, but their digital footprints (e.g., age, favourite movies, brands/products bought, location, and similar data commonly revealed online).\n\nAttendees decide whether to share these data (e.g., age, location,…) with a company that uses it to improve their services/products used by millions of people. The company doesn’t only offer an improved service, but also makes more profit, which is paid out to shareholders. Is the improvement of the service enough to trade their data? Or are they only willing to trade data for a monetary return? And if so, how much money?\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nFirst, my session will be a fun, little game to play that makes attendees think about a dilemma: share my data for a social good (i.e., improved online service)/for a monetary return, or not? Second, it will sensitise attendees to think about their digital footprints as an economic commodity: The quantities of data we produce (e.g., on social media, search engine, online shopping,…) are valuable for many companies that make huge profits from these data. After the game, I will give attendees feedback, so they see how their decisions in the game differed from the average. Furthermore, I will provide information on how to protect data online and attendees have space to talk about this experience with others and me.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nThe session doesn’t require many additional materials. To ensure that everyone can attend the session, I would appreciate at least 1-2 laptops/tablets with working Internet connection. Additionally, a board and pens to write on it would be ideal, but not urgently necessary.\n\n\n### Time needed\nAll weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session\n",

Participants will build a basic website and install Dat software on their machine in order to host it. They will then have another participant load their page and store it offline, demonstrating Dat’s P2P nature.\n\nFor advanced users, participants will learn how to access and import scientific datasets using the Dat protocol. As the main example, session leader Bruno Vieira will use his expertise as a bioinformaticist to use Dat to load datasets into analysis using Bionode, which can be easily installed on participants computers using Node.js.\n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nOur goals are to create a fun and welcoming environment for people at all levels to have fun with decentralized technology. More advanced users can explore the potential of Dat in their workflow, while people who are new to the technology can develop a better understanding of how Dat works through hands-on learning. Further goals of the session are to expose participants to open data sets, as well as introduce concepts like reproducibility and transparency, and to give them the tools to publish their own data online.\n\n\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

An API is essentially an interface that can be used to retrieve or interact with another application. Many popular online services offer such interfaces, for example Twitter, Flickr and many open source tools like WordPress. Using Google Sheets participants will have a opportunity to learn how to access and use APIs from a relative familiarity of a spreadsheet. Starting by using Google Sheets built-in formula participants will learn how to import and query data. From there more advance techniques will be introduced including writing API calls. \n\nModified from http://www.meanboyfriend.com/overdue_ideas/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4-APIs-CC-BY.pdf CC-BY Owen Stephens  \n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe goal of this session is for participants to see the usefulness and the empowerment of APIs, gaining practical skills in API wrangling which they can build upon in their own projects. As well as the opportunities of APIs this session will hopefully also highlight privacy and security issues such as the availability of data from services like Twitter. See how much data is easily accessible from APIs will hopefully allow participants to make more informed decisions about the type of information they share.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nI’ll be bringing my own laptop so a data projector is all that is needed. As this workshop is based on using Google Sheets participants should be advised that to fully participate they should bring their own laptop and if not already create a Google account. For participants without laptops or unwilling to create a Google account they will be able to follow progress from what is displayed via the data projector or if other participants with laptops are happy by pairing up.\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

We'll start with a quick crash-course on the history, political economy, and technology behind telecommunications at-large. Armed with this background, we'll segue into the blue-sky possibilities of creating your own connectivity (rather than plugging into it!) with mobile ad hoc networking protocols. We’ll dive into goTenna Mesh, the first and only way to create your own long-range, off-grid, mobile mesh network anywhere in the world, and attendees will be introduced to the brand-new goTenna Mesh open SDK which turns this new technology into an open platform. We will end with a hands-on workshop related to mobile mesh networks and decentralized bottom-up applications that can be built with the Mesh SDK.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\n+ Educate attendees about the need for and the technology that powers community/people-powered mobile mesh networks\n+ Provide access to the tools (hardware & software) necessary for attendees to build their own their own off-grid communications projects\n+ Inspire attendees to create unique applications in the decentralized connectivity space, using the goTenna Mesh SDK and/or other decentralized protocols and platforms\n+ Create a community of like-minded developers who care about building a scalable decentralized connectivity layer that may be essential to increasing scale, resiliency & access to essential connectivity\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nSince this session would involve not just people's own personal devices but also goTenna Mesh hardware (and potentially some other RF equipment we would bring), we'd just want to make sure we have counter space for people to spread out and work. Power outlets nearby would also be ideal!\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

State-sponsored surveillance, theft of personal information, trolls arrogantly abusing others—this has become normal. And every day, many of us trade personal information for convenience.\r\n\r\nIt’s time to flip the script. Not everyone knows how to install a VPN or use encryption—but everyone should feel safe online. Can we imagine a future where manufacturers respect our safety by default when they build products? Where governments take steps to protect us? Can we find fun, new ways to engage our friends and neighbours around these issues?\r\n\r\nAt Mozfest, we’ll build, teach and play with these new approaches to Privacy & Security. Let’s put safety first.\r\n",

We need to consider what we sow as well as what, and how much, we consume. \r\n\r\nIn the Web Literacy space, we’ll dig into the skills that help us read, write and participate on the web in a way that enriches both it and ourselves. Web literacy isn’t just writing Python—it’s knowing how to wield a search engine, how to craft a strong password and when our online activities are being tracked. \r\n\r\nThrough hands-on workshops, participants will explore, make and play with the tools and technologies that form the fabric of the web. And through discussion and talks, we’ll invite our guests to reflect on, and improve, their relationship with the web. Our space will instill the skills and confidence in both young and old, students and teachers, to make the web a more vibrant, diverse ecosystem.\r\n",

State-sponsored surveillance, theft of personal information, trolls arrogantly abusing others—this has become normal. And every day, many of us trade personal information for convenience.\r\n\r\nIt’s time to flip the script. Not everyone knows how to install a VPN or use encryption—but everyone should feel safe online. Can we imagine a future where manufacturers respect our safety by default when they build products? Where governments take steps to protect us? Can we find fun, new ways to engage our friends and neighbours around these issues?\r\n\r\nAt Mozfest, we’ll build, teach and play with these new approaches to Privacy & Security. Let’s put safety first.\r\n",

Digital rights are becoming a mainstream issue. The next generation of products will be trusted with more data and make more decisions on people’s behalf. To deal with those changes, people making services need common design patterns, shared language, and a community to help them make ethical decisions. \nIn this workshop participants will have 90 minutes to sketch better ways for people to share and protect their data, supported by members of the IF team. We’ll use the results to update the open-source Data Permissions Catalogue (catalogue.projectsbyif.com), a repository of approaches to consent that help product teams think differently about the things they make.\n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nWe want to expand the community contributing to the open-source Data Permissions Catalogue. In addition, and because so much of the work around privacy and security is technical or compliance-driven, we also want to engage with people who are familiar with the issues but might not have a background in thinking about it as a design problem.\nThe goal is also to think about users: what needs and considerations aren’t present in the catalogue? How can we evolve our thinking in the area, and connect with teams in the open web community who have deep understanding of disempowered or vulnerable users?\n\n\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

This session will discuss best practices for web accessibility, graphics, closed captioning, and social media and facilitate a discussion about how we can improve accessibility on a deadline.\r\n\r\nFor the session, I will prepare a quick intro of what accessibility is, what it means and who it affects. Depending on the size of the group, we will break into smaller groups to tackle specific issues in the media — e.g. How can we provide closed captioning and transcripts on quick turnaround deadlines? How can we make interactive graphics more accessible? What tools can we use to make designing content accessible from the very beginning? \r\n\r\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\r\nI hope people will leave thinking about ways to make their own work more accessible. For example, I hope people who create custom graphics will consider accessibility in their design process, and those who work on product teams can go home with tips for creating an overall more accessible website. At the very least, I think people will leave having a better understanding of how different people consume information, what accessibility means and why it is important (even for those outside of the media).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Time needed\r\n60 mins\r\n",

The rudiments of data driven journalism can be found in the older practices of computer assisted reporting or CAR, which was in vogue a few years earlier. It also derives heavily from other journalistic philosophies, particularly those which require the use of social science techniques in journalism.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe core of data journalism can be attributed to the instant and unencumbered availability of huge volumes of data which is available openly and for everyone on the internet. The concept of data journalism promises a whole new level of service to the consuming public and to business interests, with superior information, stories and content that can inspire smart decision-making.\nHere our data is IOT boards and our story revolves around different types of IOT boards available, their capabilities, what they can do, what they can't, pros and cons. Which will bring \"The high level contextual information about IOT boards\", into the lights.\nThis will help many to choose the boards based upon their requirement and provides information about the alternatives too.\n\n\n\n### Time needed\nless than 60 mins\n",

State-sponsored surveillance, theft of personal information, trolls arrogantly abusing others—this has become normal. And every day, many of us trade personal information for convenience.\r\n\r\nIt’s time to flip the script. Not everyone knows how to install a VPN or use encryption—but everyone should feel safe online. Can we imagine a future where manufacturers respect our safety by default when they build products? Where governments take steps to protect us? Can we find fun, new ways to engage our friends and neighbours around these issues?\r\n\r\nAt Mozfest, we’ll build, teach and play with these new approaches to Privacy & Security. Let’s put safety first.\r\n",

We suspect that they might be possessed by Chupadatos, the Data Sucker. \r\n\r\nThis session will use storytelling tools built at https://chupadados.codingrights.org/ to show how a context in which data is extracted in our daily relations with our CITIES, HOMES, POCKETS and even BODIES can ultimately lead to more inequality, segregation and to reinforce old power struggles that we already fight against, such as North/South asymmetries and issues of gender equality. \r\n\r\nWhy does period trackers wanna know so much about your feelings? Who owns the data of your transportation card? Are pregnant women a specific target for trackers? \r\n\r\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\r\nWe want to dismantle fake dichotomies \"privacy vs security\" or \"privacy vs innovation\" using examples that illustrate our daily activities and the correlation with the importance of data protection. \r\n\r\nOur  ultimate goal is to promote usages and development of technologies with a critical vision on data, not in a prohibitive or totally dystopian way, which might take away our agency to do anything about it, but in a conscious way, to promote better practices from all the actors involved. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\r\nprojector and sound\r\n\r\n\r\n### Time needed\r\n60 mins\r\n",

This workshop will introduce participants to a new community driven, online digital inclusion repository platform, where they can submit their best documents and slides, remix community broadband plans, translate and localize curricula, and share out their best practices.\n\nParticipants will be given an overview of the platform’s origin and a walkthrough of how it works before we all dive in to discover and build new materials together. As this repository is a work in progress, feedback, ideas and critiques will be welcomed and documented for the future of the initiative.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nParticipants become engaged in the ecosystem of sharing and localizing digital inclusion materials. This platform is just as much about materials as it is about making connections across a community of practice. This session is about having a space to share out both digital assets and personal anecdotes, with the goal of helping people move their digital inclusion priorities forward.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nJust an overhead projector should do it.\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

Taking an action learning approach, participants will take a critical look at some of the ways public libraries have embedded the foundations of coding  into story times and nursery visits, and help libraries develop and improve our under 5s coding offer.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nParticipants will leave this session with practical ideas of how to introduce toddlers to simple concepts like sequencing, critical thinking, and problem solving. They will understand the importance of helping young people develop essential coding skills from an early age and be given the skills needed to equip children in this way. Presenters will discover ways to develop and improve their under 5s coding offer.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nNothing additional. Presenters will bring a range of toys and resources aimed at under 5s.\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

They will build circuits with minimal wiring, using crocodile clips, and build games or other interactive applications controlled by physical sensors. Additionally, the physical principles on which these sensors are based will be introduced briefly.\nThe ExperiSense is an Arduino shield developed by student volunteers from the University of Warwick. It facilitates a wider range of projects to be used by educators to spark children's interest in technology.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe goal of our session is to introduce participants to the exciting possibilities of several physical sensors. By removing the worry of the usual text-based programming necessary for Arduino projects, children will be more open towards these interesting projects. By simplifying the wiring of sensors, the creative process is streamlined, so participants will experience the possbilities of using these sensors with fewer obstacles to overcome.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nEach participant must bring a laptop to take part.\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

In this workshop we focus on how we can build a less dystopian future of education, exploring how we can put people, and more specifically educators, at the heart of learning, teaching and assessment with technology. As part of this we will introduce the work of the Association for Learning Technology (ALT), its strategy and how its members have a space to contribute to the development of edtech. An important aspect of this is recognizing our members contributions. We will share work on our expanding accreditation scheme for participate discussion and contribution.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe main part of the workshop will introduce CMALT, ALT’s accreditation scheme, which has been designed to meet these challenges. By recognising skills and experience related to technology in general, but not specific software or tools, the scheme has established itself as a robust accreditation framework for professionals whose role involves edtech. Now we are seeking to expand the framework. Workshop participants will be able to examine the pilot of this new project and participate in the open, collaborative work to expand the framework.  We want to practically explore how we empower professionals who work in education to make use of the internet and technology more broadly to help meet some of the biggest challenges in education. \n\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

The session will show how digital storytelling apps are being used by people with sight and/or hearing impairments. We will also discuss projects which are developing ways to incorporate social care into digital technology, and how tangible technologies and creative methods and inventions are helping people with dementia. The session is open to all ages and does not require technical expertise. Come along, chat to researchers, try out some tech – and help brainstorm new ideas for health technologies which are clever, creative and inclusive!\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nOften perceptions and discussions of the role of technology in the area of health are focused on wearables, fitness tracking, and ‘wellness’ apps which can help plan exercise routines, suggest healthy meals and record sleep patterns. Our session aims to disrupt these perceptions of health technology by discussing and demonstrating how technology can be developed and used in relation to care, illness and/or disability. In addition, our session will highlight the importance of creative thinking and co-designing when developing new ideas, methods and solutions. Inclusion can and should begin with the development process! \n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nWe would like a projector, post-it notes and pens.

State-sponsored surveillance, theft of personal information, trolls arrogantly abusing others—this has become normal. And every day, many of us trade personal information for convenience.\r\n\r\nIt’s time to flip the script. Not everyone knows how to install a VPN or use encryption—but everyone should feel safe online. Can we imagine a future where manufacturers respect our safety by default when they build products? Where governments take steps to protect us? Can we find fun, new ways to engage our friends and neighbours around these issues?\r\n\r\nAt Mozfest, we’ll build, teach and play with these new approaches to Privacy & Security. Let’s put safety first.\r\n",

State-sponsored surveillance, theft of personal information, trolls arrogantly abusing others—this has become normal. And every day, many of us trade personal information for convenience.\r\n\r\nIt’s time to flip the script. Not everyone knows how to install a VPN or use encryption—but everyone should feel safe online. Can we imagine a future where manufacturers respect our safety by default when they build products? Where governments take steps to protect us? Can we find fun, new ways to engage our friends and neighbours around these issues?\r\n\r\nAt Mozfest, we’ll build, teach and play with these new approaches to Privacy & Security. Let’s put safety first.\r\n",

Attendees will gain privacy skills on how to protect themselves online through conversations and a hands-on workshop. They will then learn how to physically protect themselves through self-defense skills such as Krav Maga to help bridge the importance of safety and taking control of their presence online and offline.\n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nElevate the topic of online self-defense to that of real life self-defense and empower attendees to protect themselves online and offline. We also aim to give key privacy skills to those that are vulnerable online - helping them get control of their digital lives and demand better privacy.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nPens, paper, post-it notes, markers, screen\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

In the end, we could get ideas, or even have some actions already started (translations, UX mockups...)\n\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nA projector to showcase our game and games in progress.\n(A whiteboard would be great if possible?)\nWe'll also need sheets of paper (Some A0 or A1 if possible but also some A2 or A3), pens, post-it notes (of different colours if possible), blutack if we don't have a whiteboard as we'll paste some paper on the wall...\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

Do we want this to be yet another medium which follows a particular path by established exclusive voices ? \nThe session will explore the notion of over-engineering reality versus subtle engagement and acceptance for a group experience : \n- introductory lecture \n- team briefs of future scenarios to think within the framework of speculative design by using:\nstructured experiential experiments and demonstrations with participants using multisensory (haptics, acoustic controlled, 360 animated visuals) technologies made at Bushra Burge Studio\n- considering illusion experiments particularly as part of the worn experience, agency, self and the collective as consensus.\n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe outcome is to breakdown the elitist context VR and multi-sensory experience operates. The technology and associated experiences are made by and for a very small slice of society.\nTherefore the outcome is to facilitate :\n- participants to learn through experimentation with the different sensory stimulations as independent components and as a holistic experience \n- to allow for their own critical analysis of sensory and physical augmentation through worn technology\n- to empower different voices and perspectives to lead on sensory design ideas which are currently being controlled by heavily funded corporates or very niche artists. \n\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nPlease provide projector and mannequins to place haptic costumes.

Making more mini makers :D\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nRequires, plywood, acrylic, necklace chains, jump rings and pliers etc. However youthzone already owns these materials as it didn't all get used last year. I think we need to order some more keyrings though.\n\nI will require access to the lasercutter upstairs at ravensbourne, the participants will need access to computers with inkscape on - last year we had PiTops in the protyping space but we could be located anywhere.

To keep it this way, the technologies used to run the web should remain transparent and understandable.\r\n\r\nOpen Innovation is a space for challenging and learning about open source, open projects and growth on the web. We’ll investigate the challenges to open production (misinformation, draconian copyright) and the values of open creativity (working open techniques, tools and tactical transparency). The space is programmed as a highly-interactive platform for producing and protecting the principles of the open web. Join us in evolving our epically-open online world.\r\n",

The M-Lab team will prepare an interactive data exploration for MozFest attendees to explore and contribute information about their experience on the internet, to engage participants in the issues around infrastructure, access, and additional pillars from the Internet Health Report, depending on what the team wants to add. This proposal is meant as a placeholder so that we can expand with Kasia & Solana.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nEngage MozFest participants in data about the health of the internet. Allow for participants to contribute to the gallery space through some interactive engagement, and explore other participants submissions. We may also have some scheduled time in our gallery space to work with participants to build raspberry pi internet testing probes, which people could them take home and set to run tests regularly and contribute to the open data on internet health.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nWe may need a project or screens for the gallery space. I can update this later this week with information about what we'd expect to need.\n\nOffice supplied, I think we will need push pins, pens, post-its and cardboard boxes.\n\nFor the internet testing devices (mini session idea in the gallery space), we could bring some devices, but we'd be interested in partnering in some way to have devices that people could take home with them, or potentially having a prize of some sort for who can take home some of the devices we bring. \n\n\n### Time needed\nAll weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session\n",

Everyone will be able to join in, from the user’s own browser or one of our trading stations, and choose from a variety of activities.\n\n * Post new bug reports on a simple repository\n\n * “Invest” cryptocurrency in your prediction of a bug’s resolution\n\n * Contribute pull requests and comments to the repository\n\n * Watch your “market position,” and the market in general, change with bug status, and trades by other participants\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nParticipants will increase their understanding of how market mechanisms can enable participants in a collaborative project to share information, and how bug futures compare to other organizational tools such as crowdfunding and crowdsourcing. \n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\n * 2 or more demo stations with browser\n\n * Large monitor for browser running market charts and ticker\n\nThis could all fit on a medium to large table. It would be good to have a stand for the monitor showing charts, to help attract participants who are exploring the “openness” space.\n\n\n### Time needed\nAll weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session\n",

The workshop will follow a rapid prototyping methodology which involves short, time-boxed activities designed to pick apart and probe the context of the problem, and the technological possibilities of the solution.\n\nPlan International will present the user case: should birth registrations in Bangladesh be recorded in blockchain? Participants will be split into groups and the activities will require them to consider necessity, feasibility, desirability, scalability and incentive to use blockchain for birth registrations. The activities are designed so that by the end of the session, fifteen basic prototypes have been created. The three most feasible will then be further elaborated on and judged against criteria.\n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThis workshop benefits technologists and humanitarians alike. It allows techies to understand the humanitarian context their products will be applied to and allows the humanitarian sector to explore how and whether blockchain could be used in their organisations. \n\nThe activities and iterations force participants to consider blockchain contextually – whether the technology could work in a country such as Bangladesh, whether people would actually use it, whether they have the equipment and expertise to maintain it, and whether it’s worth the development costs. HumanityX is not a blockchain company, therefore have no vested interest in organisations choosing to use blockchain. Helping them decide NOT to use it is of just as much value.\n\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

State-sponsored surveillance, theft of personal information, trolls arrogantly abusing others—this has become normal. And every day, many of us trade personal information for convenience.\r\n\r\nIt’s time to flip the script. Not everyone knows how to install a VPN or use encryption—but everyone should feel safe online. Can we imagine a future where manufacturers respect our safety by default when they build products? Where governments take steps to protect us? Can we find fun, new ways to engage our friends and neighbours around these issues?\r\n\r\nAt Mozfest, we’ll build, teach and play with these new approaches to Privacy & Security. Let’s put safety first.\r\n",

The drama is based around “The Network” a technocratic world 20 minutes into the future. \n\nParticipants learn about this world by becoming involved in an interactive process to screen them for their preferences and divide them accordingly into two separate teams (Creatives or Consumers) based on their resulting personality attributes. \n\nTeams are then given role play missions to complete which involves cracking a code and altering the messages contained in the fabric of the Network’s communication structure. The final mission is to remix a Mozilla Thimble project to create their own advert to support or subvert the system. \n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nOne goal is to give participants hands on experience of coding HTML and creating their own web pages as a means of self-expression and empowerment by hands of use of digital technology. We use and promote Mozilla’s Thimble tool to do this. \n\nHowever, the primary goal is to explore issues of privacy in an accessible way also involving the emotional participation of the people taking part. We are applying the techniques pioneered by Drama specialist Dorothy Heathcote known as ‘Mantle of the Expert’ to the area of digital rights and learning to code. The immersive drama we have designed brings participants into a fictional ‘brotherhood of ideas’ making concrete some of the more abstract concepts of digital security and profiling.\n\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nnone needed\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

Concern that large corporations will restrict access to voice training data has led Mozilla to launch its Common Voice project to create open voice recognition training data. We work in one of the leading English Language and Linguistics Department in the UK. Researchers in our Department collect information about how English and Scots is spoken and analyse its linguistic characteristics. They also study how the voice works. In this session, linguistic researchers will explain how they collect information about our voice and language. We will discuss whether there are opportunities to collaborate with Mozilla’s initiatives over Voice Control.      \n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nWe want participants to learn about the range of resources created by linguistic researchers. These include open resources such as the Historical Thesuarus of the Engish Language and the Scots National Corpus. We want to build links between linguistic researchers and those working in Mozilla's Open IoT Studio and elsewhere, to see whether linguistics resources can help create more open voice control of the internet. At present, there is little contact between these researchers or awareness of potential links, and a MozFest session is a perfect opportunity to build these links. We also want to promote awareness of the fascinating research done by linguistic researchers and encourage everyone to take more interest in it.    \n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nSome loudspeakers or access to a sound system would be very helpful, as well as a projector.\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

By making all aspects of research openly available, often by use of online web technology and innovations, science can be made open to participation, open to reuse and open to the world. So far though, discussions around open science have mostly been limited to the level of research institutions and policy making. \n\nTo involve the general public in open science, we want to generate ideas for an open science exhibition. We want to show the beauty and benefits of open science, but such an exhibition can also adress issues of privacy and anonymity. We will brainstorm ideas, but also explore the floors of Mozfest for inspiration.\n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nWe will not create an open science exhibition itself at Mozfest, but collect ideas on activities and logistics (a blueprint) for people to organize such an exhibition anywhere they choose. Activities can include ideas for visitors to share research ideas, contribute data, doing analyze existing data (including data visualization), and translate research findings for a more general audience. Logistics can include ideas for contacting researchers to participate, creative use of space, and financing and publicity.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nPosterboard(s) with tacks/pins will be useful. No electronic equipment required for this one. \n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

This dystopian future is closer than you may think.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, what is the utopian version of the Internet in 2027? What future do we want to build? Where do emerging technologies like AI, mesh networking and Blockchain fit in?

I will propose that all marketplaces in fact have three sides; providers, consumers, and facilitators. The pros and cons of human vs AI facilitators will surely come up.\n\nProblems arising from modern leading marketplaces will be addressed, such as wealth imbalance, over-stimulation of the masses, and the growing burden of choice. Ideas for how the same innovative forces can be directed to produce healthier outcomes will be brought forward, namely how decentralizing the third side to many marketplaces allows for richer (more diverse) outcomes in the system. \n\n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe primary goal will be to conceptually develop a leading alternative to large media platforms as the sole distributors of advertising; under the assumption that this centralized model leads to over-stimulated and dis-enfranchised consumers, as well as wasted marketing budgets that accumulate in oligopolies.\n\nSome early propositions to guide the discussion:\n - matching small/medium companies with complimentary offerings to each other, so that they each can benefit from the other's reach\n - creating and empowering individual \"curators\" of information, for easier consumption by certain groups of people. Think newsletters, which take a whole space worth of information and deliver the most important bits to interested readers.\n\nThe secondary goal would be to begin laying the technical design for implementing a proposed solution.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nNo additional needs.\n\n\n### Time needed\nAll weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session\n",

Not everyone knows how to install a VPN or use encryption—but everyone should feel safe online. Can we imagine a future where manufacturers respect our safety by default when they build products? Where governments take steps to protect us? Can we find fun, new ways to engage our friends and neighbours around these issues?\r\n\r\nAt Mozfest, we’ll build, teach and play with these new approaches to Privacy & Security.

It is important to know (in depth) the types of violence that these communities live in. Because of this, numbers keep growing and lack of education in security issues is the key point to the permanence of this problem. \n\nProject: https://elidron.github.io/womenobservatory/en.html\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nA projector is needed. \n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

We need to consider what we sow as well as what, and how much, we consume. \r\n\r\nIn the Web Literacy space, we’ll dig into the skills that help us read, write and participate on the web in a way that enriches both it and ourselves. Web literacy isn’t just writing Python—it’s knowing how to wield a search engine, how to craft a strong password and when our online activities are being tracked. \r\n\r\nThrough hands-on workshops, participants will explore, make and play with the tools and technologies that form the fabric of the web. And through discussion and talks, we’ll invite our guests to reflect on, and improve, their relationship with the web. Our space will instill the skills and confidence in both young and old, students and teachers, to make the web a more vibrant, diverse ecosystem.\r\n",

Our Foiling Fake News Teaching Kit builds off our students’ previously mastered website verification skills, putting these skills into the new context of online current event reporting - blogs, news and fact-checking websites, satirical news sources, and more. Using Mozilla tools like Kraken the Code and X-ray Goggles, participants will get hands-on experience with lessons designed to help young people become more educated and confident internet news consumers. More details about the lessons can be found @ https://thimbleprojects.org/techkim/258242.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nOur goal is to make sure that information and digital literacy skills are constantly practiced and reviewed by parents, educators, librarians and anyone who works with children. In order to help students to learn how to find the best information online, we want to help educators feel comfortable taking a step back and letting students take control, and Mozilla has provided a fantastic set of tools that empowers them to do just that.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nWe will require a projector and pens for our session.

I recently noticed that I was unable to have productive conversations or arguments that contained certain words (racism, feminism et al) because we no longer have a shared understanding of what those words mean, so arguments devolve into fights. I spent over a year researching internet comments (strictly semi-anonymous article comments, no forums or social media) and found 10 words that have died, or lost all meaning and only exist to win or start fights. I will be guiding an audience around a museum of dead words dressed in their finest fonts, with beats & rhymes illuminating the path.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nI know it's cliché to type that I'm looking to spark conversation and create awareness, but that's exactly what this project is designed to do. More specifically, the idea is to hip us to words and phrases that are no longer useful in our typed conversations. The typed word lacks the emotion that sound or handwriting give us, so agreed upon meanings are critical to productive conversation and overall literacy in the digital age. Building capability requires understanding the new context, which requires noticing that there is a new context. Participants will walk away with tools to create more specificity in their online conversations and recognize when there is a need for it.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nWe will provide most of the materials, but will need space (preferably with a couple rooms, but we're flexible) and a place where we can mount some visual pieces. We'll need a cordless or lav mic and PA system. If you can't provide any of the the equipment, we're prepared to rent it. We will also be hiring someone local to oversee sound & stage manage. \n\n\n### Time needed\nAll weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session\n",

At a game—a real life “augmented” reality—participants will be challenged with a fun and creative scavenger hunt while learning to see things when looking. Working in teams of 3 the gamers will hunt for faces-in-places and frame as many of them with masking tape. Whether smiling, sad, bewildered, angry, annoyed, surprised, cheeky…, each guerrilla framing of a smiley (face-in-place) at Mozilla Festival brings one point. In a form of snapped photographs, whichever team collects most points in 90min wins the game and the challenge trophy.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe aim of the “Smiley Pursuit” challenge is to encourage visual literacy through design thinking in a fun and creative workshop format. The goal of this session is to draw upon participants’ intuition, imagination and creativity while exploring possibilities of what could be a great and innovative capture of a face-in-place. Outcomes of the session will be many creative and silly pictures of smileys ready to be posted as original content on participants’ social media feeds. Furthermore, once being attuned to seeing faces-in-places participants will not be able to ignore hundreds of them in their everyday. The team which collects the most points will take home a trophy for winning the challenge. \n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nThe session will require or equip participants with several weapons: tape, camera and a felt tip marker. Coloured masking tape (for easy removal) will help us frame faces-in-places. Each team will need at least one digital camera for collecting what they have been hunting down and a felt tip markers to sign each smiley with a group name. The session requires only some coloured felt tip markers from Mozilla Festival. I assume at least one person in the group will have a digital camera. The rest will be provided by me. Let the games begin!\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

This will be done by hands-on projects and conversation online w/ tribes. The Amazon rainforest covers 9 countries in the northern South America and is indicated to be responsible for 50% of the oxygen of the world. So a group of activists, teachers and policymakers will be joined in this session to try and bring a digital collective to the \"lung of the earth\". The proposers of this session already articulate universities, schools and indigenous populations into a momentum to bring consciousness about the weight and value of Amazon voices to the world. \n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nGive voices and projects to people interested in the Amazon region to ally freedom, technology and consciousness about climate change is the goal of this session, achievable by building a digital collective in the region. This will be done via documenting conversations via video, social media, creating apps and art installations on the Amazon voices perspectives. Investing heavily in integrating onsite and online participation, proposers want to bring indigenous tribes of the Amazon to talk to participants via video and to give feedback on their projects and ideas on a section called \"Conversations with Amazonian indigenous and local native population\". The idea is Mozilla Festival participants can come to our session/lounge and talk to the population in scheduled times.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nWe usually work w/ little to nothing so we need nothing. Whatever is given, though, we can use. It would be good to have a nice projector and a screen so people can see the Amazonians well. But we'll likely use mobile messaging too so if we don't have it, it's fine.\n\n\n\n### Time needed\nAll weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session\n",

When the PIR detects motion, it will trigger a photo to be taken with the Raspberry Pi Camera Module. Then the Pi will upload the photo along with a pre-set message to the participant’s Twitter account, using the twitter API implementation for Python.\n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe outcome of this session is to have the participants learn how to use the Twitter Python API, which allows them to get to grips with the basics of how to post tweets onto twitter and how to add media using the API. Our goal is to give kids an introduction into coding and showing them how they can interact with other services that they may use on a daily basis, and how they can make programs that can communicate with the outside world.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\n- Raspberry Pi\n- Screen\n- Keyboard\n- Mice\n- PIR sensor (1 Per Pi)\n- Female to Female jumper cable (3 Per Pi)\n- Raspberry Pi Camera Module (1 Per Pi)\n\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

Mini Game Jam session will introduce children aged 8-14 to creative coding and computational thinking in the context of interactive storytelling and game design. For the first 30 minutes, participants will be given access to the full version of E.A.K. and will be introduced to the basics of HTML via story-driven gameplay. For the remaining 30 minutes, we will discuss several key aspects of the game design process, such as the story, game mechanics and character design, and participants will work together in groups of 2-3, to brainstorm ideas for games.\n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nAt the end of the workshop, participants will feel inspired to use interactivity in media and learn more about the creative potential of computing. They will have looked at a number of different methods of interactive storytelling and game design, and will be familiar with the basics of programming using syntax. We aim to inspire young children, particularly girls, to want to learn more about coding, in a creative 'real-world' context, since there is currently far more of a focus on computational thinking, for this age-group.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nWe would require paper and coloured pens, and also 8-10 laptops/chargers if possible!\n\n(we have two machines available and trying to secure at least eight more)\n\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

And through discussion and talks, we’ll invite our guests to reflect on, and improve, their relationship with the web.

And through discussion and talks, we’ll invite our guests to reflect on, and improve, their relationship with the web.

We can take techniques normally used when programming, such as creating a basic outline of your system, and apply them to drawing: creating a small thumbnail of the idea before starting drawing. We can also take techniques used in drawing, like using transparent paper on top of drawings to let your art teacher correct them, and see how they are similar to code reviews.\r\n\r\nFollowing that, participants will be asked to take a program they made or like and transform it into art (or vice versa). Examples of ways to do that will be given. Afterward, participants will be able to present their work.\r\n\r\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\r\nThe goal is to show that learning to draw and learning to program can compliment each other and fuel the imagination of young people with an interest in both.\r\n\r\n\r\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\r\npens, papers, colored pencils. Participants can of course bring own materials or even existing printed artwork to show\r\n\r\n\r\n### Time needed\r\n60 mins \r\n",

Each profile will list the woman's geographic location, nationality, estimated income, languages spoken, literacy level, and the type of business she is running. \n\nIn groups (or as individuals), participants will ideate a smartphone app that is suitable to the woman's needs with the objective of supporting the growth of her business. \n\nWe will then share our app ideas and discuss some of the challenges associated with delivering product in developing communities. Some of the common challenges, based on my field experience, include lack of electricity, little to no network/WiFi access, and gender bias in terms of smartphone ownership. \n\n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThere are two main goals of this session. \n\nFirst, participants would carefully (re)consider the role of digital technology in the lives of rural women. We will debate the question of whether technology is an appropriate tool in a rural context. How do women gain access to digital technology? What are their livelihood activities? What are their concerns, needs, and desires? \n\nSecond, participants would practice problem solving and creative thinking by designing for first-time smartphone users. We will arrive at a better understanding of some of the barriers that the next 3-4 billion internet users will face as they come online via smartphone. \n\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nNo additional materials required\n\n\n### Time needed\nless than 60 mins\n",

Want to learn about it and see how we built a scraper to analyze it? Come, I'll show you how to dive into its data. At my news agency AEF, we looked for an answer to the question : Who is really in control of the European CO2 market?  The investigation showed that 40 big companies are holding back their governments on CO2 market regulation. \n\n// 60 minutes\nHands-on workshop. Let's unite forces and explore CO2 trade in 31 countries in Europe. Fancy improving the python scraper to leverage fresh 2016 data? Do you prefer focusing on Polish/Greek/German coal plants? Or digging up the \"ghost plants\" ?\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe goal is to share awareness about European CO2 market, and also enable developers and journalists to work together during a workshop. It can end up in a European collaboration. \n\nLet's talk about our experiences in this area and - if interested - exchange mail addresses to start a network and keep in touch. \n\n\n\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nJust a projector and wifi should be fine.\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

This will be done through a series of interactive drop-in sessions, moderated by ChickTech, challenging the community to help solve real world barriers to expanding the tech pipeline. Each day a new Mind Map will be started to address one current barrier to the tech pipeline and participants will join the breakout discussions or put their thoughts directly, via puzzle piece, on the Challenge Wall.  We will encourage the attendees to help identify challenge areas and come up with creative solutions together.  Through this, barriers will be broken as we create in-roads to education and training for everyone.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe goal of these sessions are to inspire attendees to apply what they have learned as they identify the challenges they face in making tech accessible to all locally. We also want all attends to walk away knowing there is community support to aid in brainstorming solutions after they return home from the conference. By talking and working together, every participant will come up with solutions needed in their local area by drawing upon ideas shared from the Mozilla global community. This area is meant to bring innovation by enabling others to lead the discussion and add to their personal tool kits by collaborating with others in the community with different expertise.\n\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nIf your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nWe will be bringing 3 blank, numbered Wall size magnetic puzzles, Custom Signage, 3 wall size sheets of blank paper for mind maps(whiteboard would be preferred if we can borrow one for the three days), colored markers/sharpies, software to copy handwritten notes into electronic form (whiteboard with screen capture would be ideal if possible)\n\n\n\n### Time needed\nAll weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session\n",

Never programmed? We don't mind, let's try!\n* Some specialised sessions over the days, discussing specific community subjects like outreach and teaching\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\n## What is the goal or outcome of your session?\n\nWe hope for multiple things, both outwards and inwards:\n\n* To make people aware of what Rust is\n* Get feedback about the project from people we usually don't meet\n* Get in touch with people outside of the programming community\n* Making people aware of how to get in touch with the Rust project\n* Clarifying the role of programming languages and communities for the general public\n* Discussing how Rust can be used to forward Mozillas mission\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nA projector would help, but is not strictly necessary.

And every day, many of us trade personal information for convenience.\r\n\r\nIt’s time to flip the script. Not everyone knows how to install a VPN or use encryption—but everyone should feel safe online. Can we imagine a future where manufacturers respect our safety by default when they build products? Where governments take steps to protect us? Can we find fun, new ways to engage our friends and neighbours around these issues?\r\n\r\nAt Mozfest, we’ll build, teach and play with these new approaches to Privacy & Security. Let’s put safety first.\r\n",

Using interactive visualisations, Lightbeam’s main goal is to show web tracking, aka, show the first and third party sites you interact with on the Web.\nIn this session, the participants will get to interact with the trackers in the VR world thus creating an immersive Lightbeam experience. With animated transitions and well-crafted interfaces, this unique Lightbeam experience can make exploring trackers feel more like playing a game. This can be a great medium for engaging an audience who might not otherwise care about web privacy & security.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe ultimate goal of this session is for the audience to know and understand about web tracking. \nWhile web tracking isn’t 100% evil (cookies can help your favourite websites stay in business), its workings remain poorly understood. Your personal information is valuable and it’s your right to know what data is being collected about you. The trick is in taking this data and shacking up with third parties to help them come up with new ways to convince you to spend money and give up more information.  It would be fine if you decided to give up this information for a tangible benefit, but no one is including you in the decision.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nVR devices - Vive, Oculus etc.\nAt this point, I am not sure about this part :)\n\n\n### Time needed\nAll weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session\n",

We need to consider what we sow as well as what, and how much, we consume. \r\n\r\nIn the Web Literacy space, we’ll dig into the skills that help us read, write and participate on the web in a way that enriches both it and ourselves. Web literacy isn’t just writing Python—it’s knowing how to wield a search engine, how to craft a strong password and when our online activities are being tracked. \r\n\r\nThrough hands-on workshops, participants will explore, make and play with the tools and technologies that form the fabric of the web. And through discussion and talks, we’ll invite our guests to reflect on, and improve, their relationship with the web. Our space will instill the skills and confidence in both young and old, students and teachers, to make the web a more vibrant, diverse ecosystem.\r\n",

Together we’ll design and build chatbots that allow people to access important but difficult to navigate online information. Through chatbots we are exploring how the design of the interface affects if someone can or cannot access the information they need, and the feelings they experience when doing so.\n \nWe’ll be using OnSequel, a free platform that allows people to create chat-bots that work on Facebook, Kik, Viber and Telegram. Either individually or in teams you’ll identify user needs and test using a particularly hard to navigate website. Your challenge, is to create a simple chat-bot which allows your defined users to access their necessary information.\n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nTo create chatbots which disseminate important but difficult to access information on a variety of different subjects. We’ll be learning to make simple chat-bots, and gaining an understanding of designing a different type of interface. \n\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

There will be an open (twitter) interface to tag projects as request to open their resources or publish details (e.g. via DocuBricks / Journal of Open Hardware). There will also be feature suggestions &volunteering opportunities for an Open Hardware innovation platform that will bridge the most popular existing digital spaces of the Open Hardware community.\nIN ADDITION to the permanent exhibit, I would also like to facilitate a 60minute hands-on developers session on the same topic, seeking additional solutions for Open Hardware platform connections and workflows.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\n(1) Increasing awareness of Open Science Hardware and motivation to contribute to their (digital) spaces in multiple languages.\n(2) Crowd-generated tag-initiative requesting projects/people to open up information and point to already open resources.\n(3) Gathering of development ideas for key (open) Open Science Hardware infrastructure projects and engagement of new volunteer developers.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nI need a well-accessible large poster board with space for two A0 posters – And if possible a screen+PC showing a feed-update of peoples participation.\nFor the session: large sheets of white paper, post-its and pens. Plugs for notebooks and a few chairs (with small table) for the discussion.\n\n\n\n### Time needed\nAll weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session\n",

We need to consider what we sow as well as what, and how much, we consume. \r\n\r\nIn the Web Literacy space, we’ll dig into the skills that help us read, write and participate on the web in a way that enriches both it and ourselves. Web literacy isn’t just writing Python—it’s knowing how to wield a search engine, how to craft a strong password and when our online activities are being tracked. \r\n\r\nThrough hands-on workshops, participants will explore, make and play with the tools and technologies that form the fabric of the web. And through discussion and talks, we’ll invite our guests to reflect on, and improve, their relationship with the web. Our space will instill the skills and confidence in both young and old, students and teachers, to make the web a more vibrant, diverse ecosystem.\r\n",

So far we trained over 300 students from under-priviledged community with this model. First stage covers, \"Basics of Digital devices\" that includes the computer, smartphone, tablets, etc., Second stage covers, \"Basic digital skills to master the web\" that includes email, search engine, browser, etc explained with real time examples for better and easier understanding along with a live demo. The third stage covers the introduction to Raspberry pi, Html and scratch programming. Learn more about 3 stage model here - https://goo.gl/XeERWj \n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nParticipants will gain basics of all digital devices - way it works, common aspects and differences among them. Participants able to effectively use newly gained digital skills - search engine, email, browsers, etc to find answers to their unknowns and critically evaluate the same for credibility. Participants learn to use Raspberry Pi, to create their first website using thimble and application using scratch - this develop their 21-st century skills and to take control of their life on the internet. Session will justify that English language barrier doesn't stop someone from effective use of internet. The gap between skills, qualification and opportunity can be addressed with digital skills. This video explain outcome from 3 stage model so far - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zidhKw6dGIc\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nWill require projector and couple of monitors to connect Raspberry pi. If monitors are not possible couple of laptops will also serve the purpose through remote desktop. I am open to run this model as a exhibit or as drop-in session through out the weekend. \n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

Power points are pretty essential, along with some tables to put microscopes on. \n\nI indicated all weekend, but actually I may only be able to come for the Saturday, and if a 90 minute slot fits better I could reorganise to make that work.  I didn't see a box for it, but this is very much a \"shed\" type exhibit.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Time needed\nAll weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session\n",

State-sponsored surveillance, theft of personal information, trolls arrogantly abusing others—this has become normal. And every day, many of us trade personal information for convenience.\r\n\r\nIt’s time to flip the script. Not everyone knows how to install a VPN or use encryption—but everyone should feel safe online. Can we imagine a future where manufacturers respect our safety by default when they build products? Where governments take steps to protect us? Can we find fun, new ways to engage our friends and neighbours around these issues?\r\n\r\nAt Mozfest, we’ll build, teach and play with these new approaches to Privacy & Security. Let’s put safety first.\r\n",

But between talk of \"surveillance capitalism,\" \"fully automated luxury communism,\" and everything in between, public debate pays scant attention to the issue of data-driven technologies and marginality. In this session, we invite individuals to gain a deeper intersectional understanding of how data-driven systems impact marginalized communities' ability to access basic human needs. Based on experiences of individuals facing housing insecurity, job insecurity, criminalization, and more, participants will explore patterns and (dis)connections in order to develop new and creative practices for keeping all communities protected, together. \n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nOur goal is to have participants:\n1. Hear stories from members of marginalized communities as they confront data-driven systems in their daily lives\n2. Connect these experiences to human rights and social justice considerations\n3. Deepen human impact of data-driven technologies\n4. Reflect and share their own experience and community stories, including how they relate or not to those of marginalized community members\n5. Talking themselves and identify for himself how data driven systems are affecting their ability to live their lives    \n6. Reflect upon existing strategies and develop new ones to confront data-driven technologies\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nNone needed.

This dystopian future is closer than you may think.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, what is the utopian version of the Internet in 2027? What future do we want to build? Where do emerging technologies like AI, mesh networking and Blockchain fit in?

As web makers, how can we provide those benefits while mitigating the risks? Consent culture, participatory design, community-focused functionality and cryptographic techniques point toward answers.\n\nWe’ll explore the process of designing systems and its connection to those risks. We know the consequences of building business products in isolation, but communication platforms are often created that way. This leads to shipping features that actively cause harm to users. We’ll discuss this predicament, share stories, dig in to causes, and look for solutions.\n\nThis proposal relies on Building Consentful Tech Zine to walk people through notions of consent: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d9VgLD29kaNj-ux8RTDwWDiTcvwdRgsRXpEDpxzHfn4/edit#heading=h.ycv3f9cdo0pw (please request access)\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nTo highlight various ways people are negatively impacted by social technology and discuss techniques for building consentful technology that prioritizes people’s right to make self- determined choices about risk and harm. Participants should leave with a basic understanding of consent culture, participatory design, and risk-mitigating implementation techniques, and how to use those in their applications. We hope to expand the conversation and to leave everyone with  some food for thought for ways in which community and consent can start becoming foundational to building technology. The point is that we all have a stake to play in the path towards consentful web and tech! \n\n\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

State-sponsored surveillance, theft of personal information, trolls arrogantly abusing others—this has become normal. And every day, many of us trade personal information for convenience.\r\n\r\nIt’s time to flip the script. Not everyone knows how to install a VPN or use encryption—but everyone should feel safe online. Can we imagine a future where manufacturers respect our safety by default when they build products? Where governments take steps to protect us? Can we find fun, new ways to engage our friends and neighbours around these issues?\r\n\r\nAt Mozfest, we’ll build, teach and play with these new approaches to Privacy & Security. Let’s put safety first.\r\n",

We will teach about how it focuses on protecting the transport of data. \nIn this session, we will share the following topics:\n•\tSafe Browsing Habits\n•\tSet Up Tor as a Proxy\n•\tHow to Securely Share Files Using Tor\n•\tComing Soon: Private Messaging With Tor Messenger\n•\tTor for Android\n•\tTor for iOS\n•\tHow to connect to Tor Via Bridges and VPN?\n•\tSafe Tools for Whistleblowers\n•\tHow to Contribute to Tor\n•\tAre there any alternatives to the Tor Browser?\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe result will be very clear, people will understand about the surveillance programs and how they can keep themselves out from it by keeping their identity anonymous. People can enormously explore new information which is not accessible to them in the normal Internet, they will also take interest to learn it because it is totally a different thing which is about to be shared in a Global level. Only 2% of Global Population know about Tor, so they will learn a lot and explore more and more about the security and privacy in today’s Digital World. Moreover our goal is to clear misconception that Tor is equal to dark or bad things on the web. \n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nProjector, Sticky notes, markers.

This session is run by one of our youth members and supported by other members of our club. It will cover:\nAn intro to Node.js – a method for running javascript on a Raspberry Pi.\nUsing Input and Output from the Raspberry Pi to control a robot.\nCreating a basic webpage to allow control of the robot.\n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nInternet of Things (IoT) is a new exciting area emerging from the world of computing. Finding a starting point to engage with this new area can be difficult, especially for individuals with little or no experience of computing. Through this session we will provide attendees with a basic skill set to build their own IoT projects, reducing the barrier to engage with this new area.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\n15 monitors, 15 keyboards + mice +15 connector cables (we have this, but if we don’t need to transport it, it would make life easier). \n\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

An initiation phase, which introduces participants to the use of new technologies as part of smart city initiatives (smart street lighting, autonomous urban vehicles etc.). The second phase would be to work with the participants (using design probes provided by us) to develop scenarios that expose threats posed by internet of things and other technology that is used on a city-wide scale (e.g. hacked smart CCTV showing a married man walking into the red light district being used for ransomware; public hate speech being spread on smart billboards in racially/ethnically/religiously divided areas etc). The third phase would be an open discussion of the developed scenarios and potential solutions for addressing the challenges.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe overarching aim of the session is to encourage critical dialogue around the shift towards Smart Cities, the internet of things technologies enabling this transition and the potential crime and security risks they create. The conversations will start with outlining the threats and then move on to exploring possible solutions to address these. The discussions would prioritise how technology design solutions can address these concerns, providing new directions for inquiry in Situational Crime Prevention, Cybercrime Policing (from the desktop to the streets) and Security by Design.\n\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

And through discussion and talks, we’ll invite our guests to reflect on, and improve, their relationship with the web.

It will focus on ideating and designing a Flag of the Earth. A brief introduction will include the history of flags, their meanings and basic principles of flag design. This will be followed by a warm-up exercise—world flag analysis. The practical part will comprise of thinking about attributes of our world and how we would present it (at an intergalactic congress for example). Through discussion our flags will be sketched while taking into account our world in all its diversity. In groups we will then design our flag symbolizing our vision of the world (positive, reactive, alarmed, etc.) and produce copies to take home.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThis session aims to provide tools and methods that will aid participants in adopting basic principles of (flag) design (applicable broadly in visual design) and finding creative ways to render complex ideas by using simple graphic elements. With advancement of our visual literacy, we will be able to consider the role of visual language in the contexts where the use of verbal expression is limited or not possible. Notably, the goal of the session is also to critically think about the role of an individual and the society in relation to the world, its sustainability, ecology, our responsibility towards it, its past, present and possible futures.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nThe session is tailored to suit the best possible learning methods and outcomes depending on the group and their age range. The session requires no electronics or specialised material. At the session we will need basic stationery: A4 copy papers, pencils, felt tip colour pens (sharpies), rulers, scissors, colored papers (as many colours as possible including black), glue and wooden skewers / chopsticks for final flag production.\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

And every day, many of us trade personal information for convenience.\r\n\r\nIt’s time to flip the script. Not everyone knows how to install a VPN or use encryption—but everyone should feel safe online. Can we imagine a future where manufacturers respect our safety by default when they build products? Where governments take steps to protect us? Can we find fun, new ways to engage our friends and neighbours around these issues?\r\n\r\nAt Mozfest, we’ll build, teach and play with these new approaches to Privacy & Security.

State-sponsored surveillance, theft of personal information, trolls arrogantly abusing others—this has become normal. And every day, many of us trade personal information for convenience.\r\n\r\nIt’s time to flip the script. Not everyone knows how to install a VPN or use encryption—but everyone should feel safe online. Can we imagine a future where manufacturers respect our safety by default when they build products? Where governments take steps to protect us? Can we find fun, new ways to engage our friends and neighbours around these issues?\r\n\r\nAt Mozfest, we’ll build, teach and play with these new approaches to Privacy & Security. Let’s put safety first.\r\n",

We need to consider what we sow as well as what, and how much, we consume. \r\n\r\nIn the Web Literacy space, we’ll dig into the skills that help us read, write and participate on the web in a way that enriches both it and ourselves. Web literacy isn’t just writing Python—it’s knowing how to wield a search engine, how to craft a strong password and when our online activities are being tracked. \r\n\r\nThrough hands-on workshops, participants will explore, make and play with the tools and technologies that form the fabric of the web. And through discussion and talks, we’ll invite our guests to reflect on, and improve, their relationship with the web. Our space will instill the skills and confidence in both young and old, students and teachers, to make the web a more vibrant, diverse ecosystem.\r\n",

We will then run a hands on workshop demonstrating some of the apps and techniques used in the project, highlighting how these fit in both delivering Arts Award and the school curriculum.  Apps include DoInk, iMovie and Tellagami.  More info on our Takeover can be found at www.seethinkmake.co.uk/takeover.html\n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nTo provide inspiration and a range of ideas for teachers, youth workers and other youth professionals to use in boosting people's digital creativity.\n\nTo increase the access for school children to the IT equipment available in schools: Several of the teachers in our Takeover school had never accessed the school's iPads and Chrome books until we ran our project, but now are using them regularly.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nWhilst we'll strive to provide android alternatives, the main apps we would be using are apple only (e.g. Tellagami and DoInk.) so we would need iPads available - a minimum of 5 where a group could share if there's large numbers.  We can bring all other materials and will also bring our own iPad.  \n\nIf this isn't available please let us know and we could see if we could borrow some iPads up here to bring or could adapt the session to include a demonstration and then ideas generation exercises on paper/through conversation.\n\n\n### Time needed\nless than 60 mins\n",

Latter has been distancing itself more and more from the traditional communication model, switching over to a much more decentralized model. We will look into what implications this shift has had for foreign politics and policymaking with other countries. How do we perceive negotiations in this time and age and how does Free Software helps us Security and Privacy -wise in these aspects? Taking lessons from Mozilla and how its strategy aims to disrupt the way we use the internet so anyone can have equal open access. Why Mozilla can be a great role model for modern diplomacy, taking some lessons from Mozilla Advocacy and the Mozilla Manifesto.\n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe goal of my talk is to show the audience that technology and FLOSS projects are effecting the international area and it's the right time to redefine the concept of the new diplomacy. The old-skool times where people could only imagine diplomacy as a high level gathering in a fancy office is now outdated. Say hello to online diplomacy and doing the same job online with a similar, if not more productive outcome traditional diplomacy has had.. Last but not least we will have a look at how the usage of a language can be a big powerplay in the diplomatic relationships of one country. \n\n\n\n\n### Time needed\nless than 60 mins\n",

Information society is now deeply embedded in digital life. For many older adults, they are often separated from this sphere of society based on a lack of skills using technology- in some ways, this is digital illiteracy. This session will help participants understand ways to facilitate learning, use approachable language, and employ practical examples to help those isolated from information society participate. There will be opportunities for small group work, sharing ideas and solutions, as well as real world examples. \n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe goal of this session is to introduce participants to the lived experiences of those living in the digital divide. More often than not, individuals who are isolated from technology and information society are older, people of color, and/or speak a non-dominant language where they reside. Since technology is part of daily life, this exclusion prevents these individuals from having access to social, government, and educational services. Understanding how to offer the opportunity to learn about using technology gives this population the access and skills necessary to participate in the modern world. \n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nI will need a projector, pens, and notepads.\n\n\n### Time needed\nless than 60 mins\n",

An insight into basic choreographic devices and movements; and the way this mirrors coding and developing technology, I.e. the idea of an achievable process open to all. Participants will be talked through simple dance structures and how to create motifs. They will then brainstorm inspiration and movements, create and put together motifs before putting on a small performance of their piece at the end of each session. \n\nA freestyle stage with 10 minute slots every hour so that individuals can show off their own skills and imagination to songs of their choice. Not only will this help to inspire others, but create recognition that dance is a universal language for all.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nTo illustrate the ever-evolving shape that technology has through dance and sound.  For each participant to have an understanding that any movement can be put together through a process which is very similar to the way in which we use code and imagination to create technology. These things go hand in hand. \nPerformance will be encouraged to highlight that there is no right or wrong, and that once a dance is choreographed it can always be developed or changed.\nThe freestyle stage looks at promoting digital inclusion through the chance to show off and celebrate each other's individuality throughout the weekend.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nSpeakers - can be arranged to be brought from home.\n\n\n\n### Time needed\nAll weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session\n",

But it’s not easy to understand why they make the predictions that they do, and if they learn from data which reflects social biases, they may reproduce them. In this interactive session, participants will learn how to open up algorithmic black boxes, explain their outputs, and discover their biases and quirks. We will try out a new explanation tool (LIME) which can explain the decisions of any classifier, whether the input is text or images. Using a web-based interactive environment, we will get hands-on with real datasets, models and code.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nParticipants will have learned how to detect biases and explain the decisions of the machine learning models behind many of the systems that affect our lives. In groups, they will have investigated models trained on specific datasets to uncover how they work and their potential biases. Participants will come away with a greater understanding of how biases can arise in algorithmic systems, which will help them to advocate for responsible use of data in their communities, companies and platforms. Participants findings and insights will be shared and collected at the end of the session.\n\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

They will make their monsters simply, with a variety of shapes and colours. Participants will be able to work together if they wish, or individually, but will have time to look at other attendees' work and learn from each other. Eventually, towards the end of the workshop, they will print out two copies of their digital artwork: one can be taken home for themselves; the other one will be put into a scrapbook called 'The MozFest Monsters Passport'. This will be a portfolio of all attendees' work, with their name, the monster's name and the Processing code.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nTo introduce participants to 'Processing' an innovative and user friendly graphics programming language based on Java. People will learn how to combine art, mathematics and computer science in a fun and friendly atmosphere.\nAfter the participants have created their 'MozFest Monster' using the interface, they will print out a copy. This will be used to make the 'MozFest Monsters Passport', a portfolio of all work from the weekend. With the creator's permission, their code and an image of their monster will be put online, via my blog and Twitter account, for the internet community to see. I hope that this will be a fun way for them to share their creativity and new experience online.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nFor this session I would require a number of Raspberry Pi computers and the necessary peripherals. In previous years, these have been provided in the Youth Zone via Pi-Top CEEDs. It would be ideal if the Raspberry Pi's had an internet connection (whether via a Pi 3 or Wi-Fi dongle), however this is not essential as the session could be delivered without the need to print, and instead I could do this later.\nWe will bring a portable printer to provide participants with a copy of their 'Mozfest Monster'.\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

State-sponsored surveillance, theft of personal information, trolls arrogantly abusing others—this has become normal. And every day, many of us trade personal information for convenience.\r\n\r\nIt’s time to flip the script. Not everyone knows how to install a VPN or use encryption—but everyone should feel safe online. Can we imagine a future where manufacturers respect our safety by default when they build products? Where governments take steps to protect us? Can we find fun, new ways to engage our friends and neighbours around these issues?\r\n\r\nAt Mozfest, we’ll build, teach and play with these new approaches to Privacy & Security. Let’s put safety first.\r\n",

To keep it this way, the technologies used to run the web should remain transparent and understandable.\r\n\r\nOpen Innovation is a space for challenging and learning about open source, open projects and growth on the web. We’ll investigate the challenges to open production (misinformation, draconian copyright) and the values of open creativity (working open techniques, tools and tactical transparency). The space is programmed as a highly-interactive platform for producing and protecting the principles of the open web. Join us in evolving our epically-open online world.\r\n",

This exhibition, created by participants during MozFest, will attempt to identify - and most importantly name - the opposite of a troll. Attendees will be encouraged to answer this question by building out a persona either online or offline - using a combination of links, images, videos and words that already exist on the internet or generated on the spot - that defies the behavior of trolls. The collected imagery and words will be projected throughout the festival to help attendees create consensus around the name and persona of an anti-troll.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nWhen we choose not to name a behavior, a belief or an aspiration, how can we call it out when we see it? It’s easy to ignore something without a name, but in divisive times, it’s important to celebrate the menches of the internet. This exhibit is an attempt to do just that - to name and identify more of the behavior we want to see online. Participants will be able to participate casually or spend more time thinking deeply about the topic. Youth are highly encouraged to participate.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nThis session will require two outlets, a projector and two computers. I can provide the computers. I can also provide a projector, but it would be easier to borrow one if possible. Finally, I will need a wall or space to project on.\n\n\n### Time needed\nAll weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session\n",

Push is specifically aimed at small and medium sized new organizations who can ill-afford the €100k it takes to build a fully custom iOS and Android app on their own. I will discuss the rationale for it, the use cases, and the decisions that went into it. For the journalists and editors in attendance I will demo its ease of deployment, its anti-censorship tooling, and discuss how to contribute support in development, design or using it in their own newsrooms. For developers and designers I will discuss how they can contribute and talk about the emerging community.\n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nPush is a project that can significantly help small news organizations both cut costs and reach wider audiences. I hope to introduce this project to the wider world and to enlarge the community around it. Push has been a solo endeavor and with my current position at the University of Missouri’s Journalism School, I’ve devoted my work solely to developing and promoting the project. I hope to engage the Mozilla family and bring a wider perspective to the needs and development of Push. It’s been a labor of love, but it needs more than I can provide on my own.\n\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nProjector, whiteboard or large post board and markers for brainstorming as well. \n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

This proposed session hopes to bring the collaborative spirit of MisInfoCon to MozFest through a session where participants will hack a news and web literacy curriculum called Mission:Information. This curriculum seeks to empower youth to become strong consumers, producers, and distributors of media online. \n\nAfter engaging in a kinesthetic warm-up activity, participants will explore and brainstorm ways to further develop the curriculum. Participants will break into groups and use tools like Thimble to work on ideas that resonate with them, whether it is adapting the curriculum for younger learners or developing associated computer science lessons.  \n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThis proposed session aims to be highly collaborative, participatory, hands-on, and audience-driven. The main goals are, first, to introduce participants to issues and concerns related to fake news and misinformation. The second goal is to discover how Mozilla’s web literacy outcomes can support and enhance news literacy education. The third goal is to give participants an opportunity to explore, and consider ways to use, an open-source news and web literacy curriculum called Mission:Information. Finally, the last goal is to engage participants in a hacking session where they can contribute their ideas and skills and work on expanding and remixing the current curriculum. Participants will guide the direction of the session and determine the focus of their breakout working groups. \n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nAttendees are encouraged to bring a personal device to this proposed session. I would need a projector and basic office supplies such as post-it notes and pens. \n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

Big tech corporations, select media companies and closed governments control the content on the Internet, the data that flows across the Internet and how people connect to the Internet. This dystopian future is closer than you may think.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, what is the utopian version of the Internet in 2027? What future do we want to build? Where do emerging technologies like AI, mesh networking and Blockchain fit in? How do we ensure people are the most important part of the Internet?\r\n\r\nJoin us at Mozfest as we look into the future. Dystopian, utopian or somewhere in between—let’s explore the Internet of 2027.\r\n\r\nSubmit a proposal now - https://mozillafestival.org/spaces#Decentralization\r\n\r\n",

Instead of using Slack, WhatsApp, or other walled gardens, we will create a temporary, local Matrix server accessible to all participants.\n\nIn addition to the existence of the server on the local network. The physical server itself should be present to drive home the privacy, control, and power that decentralization brings. If technically possible we may also want to make the server itself mobile, so that participants can pick it up and carry it around.\n\nFinally, we would like (if technically possible) to attach a visualization to the server demonstrating statistics such as number of connected users or frequency of messages sent.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\n1) To spread knowledge of the matrix system and its abilities.\n2) To demonstrate physically the nature of decentralization. Its ability to shift power, enhance locality, and benefit privacy.\n3) To experiment with making matrix homeservers portable/carryable.\n\n\n\n### Time needed\nAll weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session\n",

To keep it this way, the technologies used to run the web should remain transparent and understandable.\r\n\r\nOpen Innovation is a space for challenging and learning about open source, open projects and growth on the web. We’ll investigate the challenges to open production (misinformation, draconian copyright) and the values of open creativity (working open techniques, tools and tactical transparency). The space is programmed as a highly-interactive platform for producing and protecting the principles of the open web. Join us in evolving our epically-open online world.\r\n",

A bright green fireball, a meteor the size of a minivan travelling at 38,000 miles an hour, entered our atmosphere and exploded with a force equal to a detonation of 10 tons of dynamite. Weather radar spotted the end of its journey as it splashed down in Lake Michigan. So now it’s there… still… and nobody, not even NASA scientists, know exactly how to retrieve it. \n\nWe’ll rapid prototype solutions to this problem, with the money we don’t have, the knowledge we do have, and the innovation found through collaboration.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nStudents accustomed to school’s structured lessons can often be overwhelmed by the open endedness of creating in a makerspace. Each attendant will experience firsthand how connecting design challenges to a set narrative helps focus and free innovation. \n\nWhen students and educators can look to each other and ask, “How can we accomplish this?” and both be equally clueless about the answer, the only outcome is surprising innovation.\n\nEach attendant becomes a part of our science team. They will gain the same sense of ownership over the project that each current student participant does. Since a hunt like this has never been attempted, every question asked is important, and every idea shared has value.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nScissors\nTape (scotch/duct tape)\nCardboard\nPaper clips\nPaper\nPens\nPost-it notes\nSmall magnets\n\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

Unfortunately, the tools and resources to build in VR can be incredibly expensive and time-consuming, but it doesn’t have to be. Thanks to A-Frame, a simple, free and easy programming language, users can create and publish VR worlds in their browser no matter their tech skills or budget. In this session, attendees will learn how to create, build, and start incorporating the power of VR in their work immediately by learning the basics of A-frame and building a 360-degree tour. I will then demontrate ways in which VR can be helpful with journalism, activism, and education.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe goal of this session is to demonstrate how everyday people outside the tech industry can be creating VR using just a web browser. The dream for this presentation is to show off the incredible potential of WebVR as a platform to share learning experiences with the world and empower others to continue creating and/or teaching A-Frame + WebVR.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nI will need a projector or monitor to demonstrate my presentation and how to create in VR using A-Frame. Other than that, I plan to bring materials, such as Mozilla VR goggles, for users to test their published projects.\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

To keep it this way, the technologies used to run the web should remain transparent and understandable.\r\n\r\nOpen Innovation is a space for challenging and learning about open source, open projects and growth on the web. We’ll investigate the challenges to open production (misinformation, draconian copyright) and the values of open creativity (working open techniques, tools and tactical transparency). The space is programmed as a highly-interactive platform for producing and protecting the principles of the open web. Join us in evolving our epically-open online world.\r\n",

During the exhibition  user will control through a chatbot some of the basic devices within a home, trying to combine them and have a deeper user experience. Through archetypical shapes that represents the different functions of the house the user will have the opportunity to interact with a chatbot, express needs and receive a feedback that should be a message or a function. Six different wooden “cubes” represent basic home automation system. A fan for a temperature control system, an amplifier, a thermal printer for personal data specification, a sensor tower, a lighting system and a smart mirror. \n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nWith Postcard from Casa Jasmina, we want to bring a 1: 1 prototype of Casa Jasmina, a smart home with a  completely open source technology. Postcard from Casa Jasmina wants to show how it will be possible to interact with the home and its technologies in the future. That's why the visitor can text with the individual units using a chatbot, a technology Casa Jasmina is developing to control the smart home.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nFor the installation is needed:\n- ethernet connection with port and cable\n- power plugs \n- table or base 180cmx90\n\n\n\n### Time needed\nAll weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session\n",

Working in groups, participants will re-purpose and up-cycle generic game pieces into new games that are fun and fulfilling for each teammate. After that, they'll discuss and share the decisions and processes that made their game-designs successful. With the remaining time, participants will sketch action plans to bring those processes back home. Drawing on Mozilla's Open Leadership Training Series and its expertise in teaching about the open web, session facilitators will help participants move from play to reflection to action in planning next steps for developing open leadership in their projects and organizations.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nParticipants will leave knowing how open leadership looks and feels. They will also leave with concrete next steps they can take to introduce and implement open leadership habits and norms within their projects and home organizations. Finally, participants will be able to offer the workshop to their home organizations thanks to its highly adaptable and reproducible nature.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nI will ask my manager for a small materials budget; I anticipate needing paper, cardboard, scissors, tape, markers, dice, game pieces, game boards, play money, and other easily sourced, inexpensive crafting supplies.\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

What if they could also navigate, read content and fill out forms for you? If your assistant and browser were integrated further, would that be useful? Concerning? Could they bring accessibility benefits beyond current screen readers?\n\nWe would ask participants to group together and sketch ideas.

We’ll lead a participatory discussion on using the UPR to lobby governments to change their policies on internet regulation, and encourage our participants to formulate a series of recommendations to put to countries at the UN!\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nAfter we give an overview of the UPR process, and show how it’s been used in the past to recommend changes to the approaches governments take to regulation and control of the internet, we’ll set up some participatory activities to get our attendees thinking about recommendations that can be proposed during upcoming UPR sessions at the UN. We’ll use our data insights (our research team works on the UPR, see upriran.org for example) to show good countries to target for support, and which countries need to be targeted to change.

We will bring datasets from our D4C alumni (eg. sexual harassment in Egypt, corruption in Lebanon, LGBT rights in Uganda), which are published on our GitHub profile, and visualise them, telling a story using RAW (open source).  First, participants will form teams, ensuring a balance and range of skills and backgrounds through a brief (and fun) participatory activity. Then, we’ll give teams briefing documents for a dataset and project, and our moderators will move around the teams to provide support and guidance. We’ll give training on visualisation tools, and create final products that can be shared with the HROs that provided the initial data.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nTo work with data collected by human rights organisations to create advocacy and campaigning materials that they can use in their work. To introduce participants to the DATA4CHANGE alumni network, and encourage active participation beyond MozFest. To talk about the challenges in working with human rights data (ethics, privacy, risk involved) and to showcase the amazing work of our D4C alumni network, many of whom are working in incredibly risky environments, and in most cases not able to access ‘free and open’ internet. Our goal is to understand how we can encourage people to support HROs across the world with their skills and time to achieve core advocacy goals.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nWe will only need a projector, and will bring all other equipment ourselves. \n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

And every day, many of us trade personal information for convenience.\r\n\r\nIt’s time to flip the script. Not everyone knows how to install a VPN or use encryption—but everyone should feel safe online. Can we imagine a future where manufacturers respect our safety by default when they build products? Where governments take steps to protect us? Can we find fun, new ways to engage our friends and neighbours around these issues?\r\n\r\nAt Mozfest, we’ll build, teach and play with these new approaches to Privacy & Security.

I could see myself running a morning session and an afternoon session (about 3 hours each) for about 5 players, different players each time, in a break-out room or something.\n\nI could also permit Mozilla to give every single attendee a free PDF copy of Cryptomancer.\n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\n1) To demonstrate that security/privacy stuff can be outrageously fun in the right context.\n2) To demonstrate that security educators/advocates can get a lot mileage out of playing in the hobby/genre spaces people already occupy.\n3) To give folks ideas they can apply to their security interactions in their organizations and communities.\n4) To continue to demystify tabletop role-playing games, and show how they are a totally normal, banal, and entertaining way to pass the time, tell stories, and share positive memes.\n5) To get outrageous free press. :P\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nFor a talk, I'd like to borrow someone's laptop to present slides.\n\nFor game sessions, I'd need a table that can fit 6 people comfortably in a break-out room that's not super loud (i.e. not in a public hall).\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

State-sponsored surveillance, theft of personal information, trolls arrogantly abusing others—this has become normal. And every day, many of us trade personal information for convenience.\r\n\r\nIt’s time to flip the script. Not everyone knows how to install a VPN or use encryption—but everyone should feel safe online. Can we imagine a future where manufacturers respect our safety by default when they build products? Where governments take steps to protect us? Can we find fun, new ways to engage our friends and neighbours around these issues?\r\n\r\nAt Mozfest, we’ll build, teach and play with these new approaches to Privacy & Security. Let’s put safety first.\r\n",

The space is programmed as a highly-interactive platform for producing and protecting the principles of the open web. Join us in evolving our epically-open online world.\r\n",

We want to create a welcoming, honest place to talk about the challenges faced by open communities, people working openly, and innovative projects. Not all stories will wrap up cleanly. Not all stories will have happy endings. Sometimes things don't work out. Sometimes things get messy. It's all part of the process and we've all been there, so let's talk about it! We have a few people committed to speak now, others will be able to sign up via our GitHub repository (https://github.com/daniellecrobinson/The-Up-Side-of-Down). At the event, time will be reserved for people to speak on the spur of the moment. \n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nInnovation is messy. The myth of the lone innovator that western culture embraces is that of a man alone in his garage. He overcomes challenges and eventually finds success. But this narrative is flawed, exclusionary, and discounts the value of community. The goal of this session is to provide an open forum to talk about challenges faced by innovators and innovative communities. We'd like to showcase stories of ideas that didn’t quite work. Stories of spectacular failure. Stories of reinvention. Stories of communities facing real world issues. By creating a supportive environment to talk about challenges, we can bust the “lone innovator” myth, surface stories from the community, and build personal supportive connections within the innovator space.\n\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nA microphone would be great!\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

After that, we'll spend 60 minutes hacking on some pre-built demos to create some awesome experiences. \n\nChanges to the demos (of which there are three) can be seen in real-time, we will be using open source tools such as Thimble, A-Frame, Voxel.js and more! As well as Minecraft for Pi. Each demo will range in sophistication, so that everyone regardless of programming experience can have a fun and enjoyable time.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe goal is not only to get people excited about programming & game development, but to also have the confidence to take their skills and create their own \"mod\" as commonly referred to by the game development community. Modifying games is a very rewarding experience, and very popular in games such as Minecraft.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nI would need access to a Projector that has either an HDMI, or Mini-Display connection port. I would also need temporary access to 10-15 computers (Pi Tops, Laptops, Tablets w/Keyboard, etc). As well as some paper & pencils.\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

Come visit the skilled baristas who are handing out Data Detox Kits, an 8 day programme to rid yourself of all the poisonous data clogging your digital ecosystem.  \n\nWe've previously held Data Detox Bars at the pop-up shop \"The Glass Room: Looking into your online life\" in New York, USA and at Welcome Refugee Days at Kista Library, Stockholm, Sweden. We found it was a useful way to communicate the basics of online privacy to a general public with little or no experience in the topic. In the session we will highlight the role libraries and community centres can play in digital literacy outreach projects.\n\nLinks: https://tacticaltech.org/glass-room-suitcase; https://twitter.com/akenyg/status/879427640221986816; https://twitter.com/auremoser/status/878306406662799361\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe goal is to 1) raise awareness of digital privacy and the data flows of our everyday life, 2) present a simple tool on how to minimise the flow of your personal data to other people and services, and 3) to showcase how digital activists of all kinds - be it librarians, teachers... etc. - can reach out and get through to average users by hosting a simple set-up event with a minimum of resources and previous skills (this is based on the fact that not all people are data experts, but many people still care about the lack of online privacy).\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nA bar (similar to the apple genius bars), i.e. a couple of tables, preferably in standing height\nIt would be great to have power strips so that the bar can be used as a \"charging station\" for devices (a multi-functional bar would be great for the visitor numbers :)\n\n\n\n### Time needed\nAll weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session\n",

Partners will discuss everyday situations that put their online lives at risk and then think about the options they have to make these situations healthier with tools and good practices. Participants will then introduce themselves and share the situations and solutions they thought of together. Finally, participants will take their boards, read the rules, and begin to play, learning, discussing the situations they invented, and sharing their solutions to them. Participants will leave with enough privacy & security experience to “level up” as new specialists in privacy and security!\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\n1. Participants will learn strong  online security and privacy practices and begin to change their unhealthy habits; \n2. Participants will leave knowing how to use this game to lead Privacy and Security Situations Challenge sessions in their local communities;\n3. Participants will leave inspired to create their own games using the extensive Privacy and Security Situations Challenge board;\n4. Participants will localize and translate the default game into other languages.\n\n\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

State-sponsored surveillance, theft of personal information, trolls arrogantly abusing others—this has become normal. And every day, many of us trade personal information for convenience.\r\n\r\nIt’s time to flip the script. Not everyone knows how to install a VPN or use encryption—but everyone should feel safe online. Can we imagine a future where manufacturers respect our safety by default when they build products? Where governments take steps to protect us? Can we find fun, new ways to engage our friends and neighbours around these issues?\r\n\r\nAt Mozfest, we’ll build, teach and play with these new approaches to Privacy & Security. Let’s put safety first.\r\n",

The second part will be a weekend-long drop-in shed space where participants can build prototypes of their ideas to run as an escape room during the closing demo fair at MozFest.\r\n\r\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\r\nWe have two major goals. First, we want to help people better understand the kinds of interactions they might be subject to in a smart city full of connected devices so they can talk about the kind of healthy, connected future living spaces they want for themselves and their communities with privacy as society’s default setting. Second, we want to produce a prototype and documentation (in a GitHub repo) of an escape room that participants and local community organizations - like libraries - could use to teach the same ideas, vocabulary, and visioning participants experience at MozFest.\r\n\r\n\r\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\r\nWe could use a projector or screen in our classroom and shed space, as well as paper-prototyping materials like markers, tape, glue, scissors, cardboard boxes, and paper. We will provide any necessary IoT devices or larger prototyping materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Time needed\r\n90 mins\r\n",

State-sponsored surveillance, theft of personal information, trolls arrogantly abusing others—this has become normal. And every day, many of us trade personal information for convenience.\r\n\r\nIt’s time to flip the script. Not everyone knows how to install a VPN or use encryption—but everyone should feel safe online. Can we imagine a future where manufacturers respect our safety by default when they build products? Where governments take steps to protect us? Can we find fun, new ways to engage our friends and neighbours around these issues?\r\n\r\nAt Mozfest, we’ll build, teach and play with these new approaches to Privacy & Security. Let’s put safety first.\r\n",

The inspiration comes from years of research in combination with some spectacular ideas developed at the ECMWF OpenDataHack 2017. Some examples? Have you ever seen a robot dancing according to the intensity of the rain or the wind speed? Do you know that you can predict malaria outbreaks using temperature and precipitation data? These and other ideas will be demonstrated live, come and join us! And if you have additional ideas, talk to us… we could demo them next year! \n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nOn the one hand, we want to show the public all the wonderful things that can be done with ECMWF open data, beyond predicting the weather. On the other hand, if these ideas sparkled the imagination, we would like to know what else people would use this data for.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nTBC\n\n\n### Time needed\nless than 60 mins\n",

Big tech corporations, select media companies and closed governments control the content on the Internet, the data that flows across the Internet and how people connect to the Internet. This dystopian future is closer than you may think.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, what is the utopian version of the Internet in 2027? What future do we want to build? Where do emerging technologies like AI, mesh networking and Blockchain fit in? How do we ensure people are the most important part of the Internet?\r\n\r\nJoin us at Mozfest as we look into the future. Dystopian, utopian or somewhere in between—let’s explore the Internet of 2027.\r\n\r\nSubmit a proposal now - https://mozillafestival.org/spaces#Decentralization\r\n\r\n",

Instead of taking data to the cloud, Databox takes computing to the data through a unique app environment enabling local, privacy-preserving data processing that puts citizens in control. The session will enable participants to get their hands on the Databox application SDK and explore for themselves how novel apps leveraging personal data sources may be developed and shared. Participants will learn how to install and configure the Databox and App SDK, build drivers to leverage personal data sources, and create privacy-preserving apps that process personal data derived from multiple sources. \n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe session seeks to enable Mozfest participants to get their hands on the Databox application development environment and explore for themselves a radical alternative to the current technological infrastructure that underpins dystopian visions. In doing so we hope to learn from our participants of the challenges that confront a decentred future, the potential of the Databox platform to address these, and key application areas that might motivate and drive decentralisation forwards. In addition to getting their hands on an alternative future, our participants will be encouraged to feedback their experiences, reflections and thoughts on the Databox platform and the steps we need to take to make decentralisation happen.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nAccess to IoT data sources will be provided to participants and requires the installation of sensors and a dedicated network, and ready access to power sources is required to run two Databoxes and peripherals to support app creation over the duration of the session.\n\n\n### Time needed\nAll weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session\n",

At the beginning of our session, we will briefly describe what we do to help those who recently arrived in Italy to grow their digital skills, participate actively in the Internet community, and become aware of their rights as Internet citizens. We will present our activities and the challenges we face (gaps in digital literacy, cultural differences, etc). The main part of the session will be interactive: we will ask the audience to come up with new, creative ways to tackle these challenges, creating a map linking problems and possible solutions which we will then use and share.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nWe would like to 1) inspire people living in other countries of destination of migrants coming from the Global South to undertake similar technology education projects, aimed at the migrants' digital inclusion; 2) be inspired ourselves by new ideas, methods, and strategies to be more effective in our efforts to include migrants, asylum seekers, and refugees as active citizens of the Open Web; 3) create a practical resource in the form of a map that people leading similar projects can use, add to, and share.\n\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

In our session we want to design a questionnaire to evaluate how these, often vulnerable, populations view the research done on them, and brainstorm on how members of underrepresented minorities can be better integrated in all steps of scientific studies, to foster inclusion, representation and lead to better science. We want to launch a discussion, where we hope to hear from everyone whether studies performed on their communities are representing them well and how this could be improved.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe goal is to get a first insight into how members of underrepresented minorities perceive research done on them. To this aim, the outcome will be a collectively designed questionnaire that will be addressed to vulnerable populations and will quantify the extent to which they perceive research done on them as useful and respectful. The long term goal is to use collectively built knowledge to eliminate the artificial divide between researchers and research participants and identify ways and interactive platforms that can bridge the two.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nSome paper and pens for the people to take notes.\n\n\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

Most of us barely have data. But there is virtually no training in scientific computing for people with small (or reasonable) needs. What if I don't want to run distributed code? What even is Hadoop? Can I still do scientific computing? In this session, we will try to answer \"Yes, you can\", and then work on determining the \"minimum skills\" for scientific computing, for people that don't have big needs.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nWe will start planning the collaborative development of peer-reviewed teaching resources. I anticipate that this will take the form of Jupyter notebooks, promoting the integration of code, data, figures, and narrative. Ideally, a first version would be release within 6 months from mozfest.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nA projector will be sweet.

Big tech corporations, select media companies and closed governments control the content on the Internet, the data that flows across the Internet and how people connect to the Internet. This dystopian future is closer than you may think.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, what is the utopian version of the Internet in 2027? What future do we want to build? Where do emerging technologies like AI, mesh networking and Blockchain fit in? How do we ensure people are the most important part of the Internet?\r\n\r\nJoin us at Mozfest as we look into the future.

The process involves as much drawing as it does thinking and writing, and is solution-oriented.\nWe use the wealth of experience that participants and facilitators have to take apart a problem and look at it from a different angle. We will go off at tangents and down rabbit holes, but that's all part of the process!\nOur starting point will be whatever issues participants bring to the table after our icebreaker activity, and we have our own experiences as a worker's co-op to add to the mix.\n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nParticipants can expect to be getting stuck in with drawing, post-it-ing, and joining concepts together with string - but the real key to a Thinkathon is learning how to listen to others, and encouraging the quiet or seemingly silly thoughts. We'll tweet and blog the visual and written artefacts from the session, in order to include a wider audience in an ongoing conversation.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nWe'll be using the following materials (which we can bring):\n - A3 thick paper\n - Pens\n - Post-its\n\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

The discussion will hone in on what kinds of weaponized disinformation voters were exposed to and what if any impact it had on their view of their local elections. This will not be a discussion of political campaign tactics but an attempt to find patterns and workable solutions that come from real world conversations from the view of a voter.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nA deeper understanding of common patterns and themes that voters across Europe were exposed to before heading to the polls in their local elections.

We want people to experiment by themselves that the Web isn’t just 2D pages but can also be immersive. We also want to showcase that \"cross-device\" concepts also work in WebVR, by making people to play together on different devices (computer/Gear VR/Oculus Rift/HTC Vive headsets).\nFinally we want to show them that the Web is easy to remix, by making them customize their experience.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nWe will try to bring multiple Gear VR headsets, but to showcase the responsiveness of the app through devices, it would be cool to be able to have a couple of Oculus Rift / HTC Vive setups.\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

We’ll investigate the challenges to open production (misinformation, draconian copyright) and the values of open creativity (working open techniques, tools and tactical transparency). The space is programmed as a highly-interactive platform for producing and protecting the principles of the open web. Join us in evolving our epically-open online world.\r\n",

Working groups include privacy, security, provenance, permissions and others. We'd like to share this work with the Mozilla community as we'll be applying to register the certification mark by the end of 2017 and want more eyes on the approach and topic. \n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nDiscuss the language that has already been done and document comments from the community at Mozfest. We would also like to engage anyone who would like to help us build the global presence / policing of the mark. \n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nWe'd like to have a projector and a tabletop flipchart if possible. \n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

And through discussion and talks, we’ll invite our guests to reflect on, and improve, their relationship with the web.

Another goal is to create awareness that websites should be optimised for performance.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nA projector would be cool :) I could do without one if the group size stays below ~10.\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

We’ll investigate the challenges to open production (misinformation, draconian copyright) and the values of open creativity (working open techniques, tools and tactical transparency). The space is programmed as a highly-interactive platform for producing and protecting the principles of the open web. Join us in evolving our epically-open online world.\r\n",

Responding to different settings as they move randomly through the room, participants will experiment with decentralization and try to find out where a hidden center might be. The structures and connections that the group would form, will respond to similar social dynamics within digital ecosystems.\n\nReflection. After experimentation, they will reflect upon the meaning of decentralization, regarding the internet as a network.\n\nVisualization. Considering decentralization as a goal, they will reflect upon the political and economical forces that sustain and take advantage of the center (meaning for example that 5 companies are capturing 85% of all the data)’. They will also review their own standing in relation with the ‘center’ and how this standing influences the way they act.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nRAISE AWARENESS. Demonstrating through experimentation and reflection that:\n\n-       when we talk about decentralization, there is always an implicit or explicit referring center. If there were no center at all, the notion of decentralization would make no sense.\n-       decentralization is not moving away from a center, it is conceiving the system through a different paradigm\n-       the resolution of the ‘centralization – decentralization’ tension is a matter of power\n-       we are always involved in these tensions as we interact with others through digital ecosystems\n\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\n- Projector\n- Paper, pens, post-it notes\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

We need to consider what we sow as well as what, and how much, we consume. \r\n\r\nIn the Web Literacy space, we’ll dig into the skills that help us read, write and participate on the web in a way that enriches both it and ourselves. Web literacy isn’t just writing Python—it’s knowing how to wield a search engine, how to craft a strong password and when our online activities are being tracked. \r\n\r\nThrough hands-on workshops, participants will explore, make and play with the tools and technologies that form the fabric of the web. And through discussion and talks, we’ll invite our guests to reflect on, and improve, their relationship with the web. Our space will instill the skills and confidence in both young and old, students and teachers, to make the web a more vibrant, diverse ecosystem.\r\n",

During this session we will teach participants about open source tools that are being used today by live fact checkers to create annotated transcripts. They will learn about an open service called Opened Captions and how it can be used in conjunction with google doc to get real time transcriptions of political speeches. \n\n\n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThis is an hands on session, drawing on experience from Vox and NPR collaboration participants will also be shown how to export the annotated speech from the google doc into a news article static web page, that could be ready for publication.\n\nParticipants will walk away with their own system in place for live-transcript annotation.  They will also more generally understand how to utilize open source tools to accomplish their goals.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nNot that I can think of for now\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

We still read static A4 static pages albeit digital, and search simple list databases that do not capture the full depth of a scholarly article.\n\nIn this session we imagine a world where all scholarly content is freely reusable. What new ways to consume scholarly reports can we think of? What ways to sift through the faster growing literature for the content you need? How to connect researchers while doing so? How to find reliable content instead of just related content?\n\nThere are thousands of ways to consume information, only few to sell information. Let's show the potential for innovation in scholarly consumption when open content is the norm.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe goal is to stimulate idea-generation for information consumption of scholarly content. \n\nThe outcome will be a list of publicly available ideas, providing grounds for development after MozFest. \n\nAdditionally, connections during the session stimulate community driven efforts to put these innovative ideas into practice for the content that is already freely reusable (i.e., Open Access content).\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nA flipover/windows and whiteboard markers. Post-it notes and pens would be cool, but I can provide those myself as well.\n\n\n### Time needed\nless than 60 mins\n",

Film is a strange product! It costs millions of dollars to make, has zero physical value, and is instantly copied and shared (without cost or permission)... the worst product in the world. Yet, there is no lack of demand.The average american watches 5000 movies in a lifetime. That is one trillion guaranteed sales. I want a piece.. but after distributors, aggregators, marketing, 90% of profit is gone, if any. Many see blockchains as an important stepping stone toward the Internet of Things, a decentralisation that brings creator, seller, buyer closer together. I will share my R&D with the audience and ask for feedback.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nTo go home wiser than I came, and to wish the same for others. I am no expert on blockchains, Internet of Things, and I don't know to program any code. But I know what I want and need for my own company and the film Industry. So by reaching out and giving a session on film distribution, I hope to get a response, to get people involved to help shape the future for creators and let them be the driving force of technology. I hope that there will be people in the room with expertise and/or interest in applying blockchain and Internet Of Things to filmmaking and distribution of film\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nI do not need anything. But if there is the possibility of connecting my laptop to a big screen,\nI will want to know, because I am going to use it.\n\n\n### Time needed\nless than 60 mins\n",

Web literacy isn’t just writing Python—it’s knowing how to wield a search engine, how to craft a strong password and when our online activities are being tracked. \r\n\r\nThrough hands-on workshops, participants will explore, make and play with the tools and technologies that form the fabric of the web. And through discussion and talks, we’ll invite our guests to reflect on, and improve, their relationship with the web.

I want to introduce solutions for communities with low/no connectivity to learn basic web skills. \n\nHere, I propose a session to share several offline activities through which we can teach and learn. Since this is a participatory workshop, participants can create their own unique activities as we progress. We'll discuss about their impact on community and importance of offline learning. Some examples:\n1. Learning Web Mechanics offline\n2. 'A Strong Wind Blows'\n3. 'Web Mechanics Speed Dating'\n4. Using Slides and video captures to explain the basics of Internet (working of web browser etc).\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe basic outcome will be more Web literates around the world. It would be great that participants take home with them resources and ideas on how to take this event format forward, and spread web literacy even without any connectivity. Participants can organize and use this format in their communities using resources, activities, or creating their own resources accordingly.\n\nWe have already reached many local regions using these tools and well be targeting more such regions going forward. Participants will be free to plan events and provide more insights after the session and anywhere in the future.\n\nPS:This session was accepted last year but due to Visa issues I couldn't make it. So i wish to present it this year.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nFor my session, I will need some cardsheets, post-it notes, a projector and some markers.\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

We want to explore whether there are common needs and desires across cultures, countries and demographics to help inform the projects that people are working on for the Wireless Innovation for a Networked Society (WINS) Challenges.\n\nWe will collect user data in a creative and fun way to help the WINS Challenges teams truly respond to human needs. Using disaster scenario playing cards, we will be asking people to contribute:\nThe people they’d want to contact\nThe apps they’d want to access\nThe resources they’d need most\n\nPotential scenarios include:\nEarthquake\nHurricane\nMajor power outage\nUrban community with slow speeds\nRemote community with no Internet access\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nImagine your life without the Internet. What connections to people would you lose? To the things you love? To vital information about your community? \n\nThe Wireless Innovation for a Networked Society (WINS) Challenges, run by Mozilla and sponsored by the National Science Foundation, seek practical, innovative wireless solutions that will help connect people to the Internet in challenging circumstances: after a disaster or in areas without sufficient connectivity.\n\nJoin the project by sharing your immediate reactions and needs in the face of the unknown.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nIf we could get a monitor and laptop (with power and wifi), that would be great.\n\n\n### Time needed\nAll weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session\n",

Facts are excluded from the intellectual property rights regime, as they are not creative works. Limiting access to facts is a very unintellectual idea. \n\nA new \"data producers right\" is being pitched in Brussels. The idea is to incentivise the opening up and sharing of data by establishing a new exclusive right on it. This is silly and scary.\n\nThe session will explain the idea that drives this proposal within some Member States and the European Commission and work on arguments and examples that speak against it. We will share with the participants how far along the process is and what we are likely to expect.

This dystopian future is closer than you may think.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, what is the utopian version of the Internet in 2027? What future do we want to build? Where do emerging technologies like AI, mesh networking and Blockchain fit in? How do we ensure people are the most important part of the Internet?\r\n\r\nJoin us at Mozfest as we look into the future.

We’ll also talk about how we use Dat inside of Beaker. Dat is a peer-to-peer file sharing protocol that makes it possible to host websites from your local device.\n\nWe’ll then guide attendees through the Beaker installation process and step through an interactive demo, which ends with users learning how to make and publish a peer-to-peer website.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nOur goal is to clarify what threats are posed if the Web remains centralized. We hope to articulate what flaws must be addressed in the Web’s architecture in order for the Web to be robust, open, and free for all.\n\nWe expect participants will leave with a clear sense of how modern peer-to-peer file sharing protocols provide tools to make Web publishing simple and very cheap, and how Beaker is using the Dat protocol to enable decentralized Web publishing and to build applications where users retain authority over their data.\n\nBy the end of the session, attendees should feel confident using Beaker to publish and share files, and perhaps even to use Beaker’s DatArchive Web APIs to create peer-to-peer websites.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nWe need a projector to display our demos and guide participants through the interactive tutorial.\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

Even better if we have some hardware (ie. laptops or iPads) where we can show people directly how to contribute.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nImagine if the internet worked like voice recognition: First, I would have to register my website with some vendor like Microsoft, and build a Microsoft specific version on my site that only worked on Microsoft devices. I would have to share 30% of my revenue with Microsoft, and make sure my business didn't compete with them. At any point Microsoft could choose to delete my website. The internet as we know it would simply not exist if it worked like this. The goal of my session is to educate people about this state of affairs, and show how Common Voice can help the situation by opening up opportunities for researchers/universities/startups/hobbyists, etc to build voice services without relying on Google/Amazon/Apple/etc.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nHaving a computer with a microphone (or laptop), or several iPads would be helpful as I could get people to donate right there.\n\n\n### Time needed\nAll weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session\n",

To keep it this way, the technologies used to run the web should remain transparent and understandable.\r\n\r\nOpen Innovation is a space for challenging and learning about open source, open projects and growth on the web. We’ll investigate the challenges to open production (misinformation, draconian copyright) and the values of open creativity (working open techniques, tools and tactical transparency). The space is programmed as a highly-interactive platform for producing and protecting the principles of the open web. Join us in evolving our epically-open online world.\r\n",

Given that current government information channels are slow and inefficient, most of the official Facebook pages for government bodies have moved to a Messenger-based support model where people ask a very large amount of questions about common procedures and public servants try to answer them as quickly as possible.\n\nWe built a service that automates these conversations using AI to provide instant information to the citizen and user feedback to the government so they can improve their service.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nParticipants will be encouraged to suggest a few common government service/information requests that they have struggled with in the past. We will divide ourselves into groups and try to design very simple yet powerful conversation flows that we could automate by answering big picture questions e.g.:\n\nWhat does the citizen really care about when asking about this service?\nWhat is the most user friendly way to display the information required by the citizen?\nWhat is the most common problem citizens face with this service and how can we solve it?\nWhat additional tools could we provide to exceed citizen expectations?\n\nI will provide materials (cardboard chat bubbles, buttons, images, maps) so participants can build a physical snippet of their conversation flow during the session.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nPens, markers, and pieces of paper so participants can write their conversation flows and in case my supply of cardboard pieces runs out.\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

The first half of the session will be a guided introduction to 3D modeling, texture baking, material management, and basic rigging and animation. The second half will focus on importing those assets to a WebVR scene, and designing the interaction using A-Frame components.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nParticipants will be able to create indie-game quality low-polygon textured 3D assets, and use them in an interactive WebVR experience.  I hope the session is packed with students who can't afford Maya.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nProjector to demonstrate.  Internet to allow them to download assets and dependencies.  VR headsets for previewing the VR experiences: HTC Vive, Rift, GearVR, Daydream -- whatever works with A-Frame.\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

This session would aim to identify possible root causes as well as ways to remedy this / encourage open source and peer reviewed code. \nA short set of slides would provide an intro to the issue and to the academic publishing peer review model. This would be followed by a group workshop whiteboard / sticky note activity & wrap-up discussion.\n \nDiscussion Topics:\n- Why is code so often seen as okay to be proprietary, even in science where peer review is vital?\n- Who do we need to influence?\n- How can we change things?\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nTo identify root causes of closed-source software in science, along with ways to change culture in the future, and perhaps even ways to measure change along the way. I hope that discussion with open-source enthusiasts would be a good way to facilitate this. \nA second but no less important goal would be to gather names of like-minded people with whom to collaborate to help push this forwards.\nFinally, non-academic attendees would hopefully be exposed to academic behaviours such as paper publishing, peer review, and the importance of code in modern science. Not all science involves lab coats and test tubes! \n\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nA1 poster-size paper sheets on a flipboard or a whiteboard for writing discussed items; \n\nEnough sticky notes and pens for everyone to be able to write brainstorm ideas down. \n\nA projector for the (short) intro slides and perhaps to bring up websites that might be discussed during the workshop if relevant.\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

This dystopian future is closer than you may think.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, what is the utopian version of the Internet in 2027? What future do we want to build? Where do emerging technologies like AI, mesh networking and Blockchain fit in? How do we ensure people are the most important part of the Internet?\r\n\r\nJoin us at Mozfest as we look into the future.

This will be interspersed with audience participation in the form of open discussions about how participants currently publish content to the web. We'll look to discuss the challenges and opportunities we face using a somewhat centralised web through existing social network platforms like Facebook. A referee for this session is Tantek Çelik. As well as being one of the movement’s co-founders, he is also a Web Standards lead at Mozilla in San Francisco. \n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nFrom the session I hope participants come away from it more engaged and interested in the way they publish content and manage their presence on the web. I hope that they will be more aware of the Indieweb community and feel compelled to contribute to it in any way they can be that through code, design, written documentation or simply fresh insight. From the audience participation I’d like to learn more about what everyday challenges people face using an increasingly centralised web and feed this back into the movement’s own discussions to make it more attractive to new community members.\n\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",

With this one, I'll not raise the number of those but want to demonstrate what happens if things go/done wrong. While it is more or less a fun talk, I'll give some very useful hints on how to prepare yourself for a talk and to give a talk. This talk lives from participating in it, so I will encourage you, the audience to share your thoughts on public speaking and talk with you about it.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nTo lower the fear of doing a public talk and to show the benefits. Also, with inviting the audience to speak up about their experiences I want to show that we all can be speakers and should be, to share our ideas.\n\n\n\n### Time needed\nless than 60 mins\n",

For the design challenge, participants will be given everyday objects, like cardboard and sticks, and challenged to create a parallel processing system that can sort objects accurately using multiple channels. This activity will help participants to explore AI parallel processing concepts, as they will be given a large data set (marbles and ping pong balls) that they need to build a system to process and sort. To sort quickly they will need to divide the data among many channels, or parallel processing channels. After the design challenge, we will discuss how this system relates to big data and how parallel processing can solve tomorrow's questions. See the design challenge here http://tiny.cc/ai_dc\n\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThe goal of this session is for participants to better understand parallel processing, a core piece of AI innovation. My hope is that a better understanding of this concept will demystify AI and better help participants to understand where they plug into the technology and what problems can be solved. Parallel processing sounds like a scary concept, but the design challenge helps people kinesthetically explore the principals. The open-ended discussion will be focused on ideas and exploration, instead of any pre-defined end point.\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nFor this session, I would need a/v with a projector and sound. \n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

State-sponsored surveillance, theft of personal information, trolls arrogantly abusing others—this has become normal. And every day, many of us trade personal information for convenience.\r\n\r\nIt’s time to flip the script. Not everyone knows how to install a VPN or use encryption—but everyone should feel safe online. Can we imagine a future where manufacturers respect our safety by default when they build products? Where governments take steps to protect us? Can we find fun, new ways to engage our friends and neighbours around these issues?\r\n\r\nAt Mozfest, we’ll build, teach and play with these new approaches to Privacy & Security. Let’s put safety first.\r\n",

There is need to re-situate the narrative for the ordinary citizens online and even offline. The Internet is decentralizing power and the time isn't more right to have a continent of more that has not less than an average of 30 years of  longest-serving governments to open up spaces for new conversations and participation.\nThe session seeks to have the experts in the room to discuss how this can be achieved. This includes how to further consolidate areas of strength on working on models that balance out the dystopian and utopian future of the open web in .Africa. \n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nThere are currently working models designed by Coalitions to work on policy shifts and difficult conversations about the Open Web. The outcome of this session will be to consolidate these efforts and design a more future-facing models that can withstand the dynamics of changing environments and policies.\nThe endemic shutting of the Internet, wanton disregard for freedom of expression online, privacy and security issues in Africa especially are not only hurting the continent's chances at globalization but also robbing the world of Africa's contribution to innovative ideas. This session seeks to correct that.

Web literacy isn’t just writing Python—it’s knowing how to wield a search engine, how to craft a strong password and when our online activities are being tracked. \r\n\r\nThrough hands-on workshops, participants will explore, make and play with the tools and technologies that form the fabric of the web. And through discussion and talks, we’ll invite our guests to reflect on, and improve, their relationship with the web.

One master player is the “pulse”, one other is “silicon”, representing privately owned networks, all other players are “local coop”. Each player pays and receives coins to pulse, and can enact production and initiatives forming card decks. Local coops can collaborate trying to establish a special “network” deck that can be crucial to compete with “silicon”.\n\nThe combinatorial space of the cards is quite large and many different outcomes are possible.\nMore information of the EU project and the game design mechanics is available on request.\n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nI have recently worked on a EU project on evolving digital services for platform coops (references: Uberworked and Underpaid: How Workers Are Disrupting the Digital Economy by Trebor Scholz, https://platform.coop/). As a consequence of this experience, I have designed a board game that mixes role playing, card deck building, collaborative gameplay and transformative narrative aimed at exploring platform coops and their integration.\n\nI am an experienced game designer of applied games (see https://designagame.eu/), and the game would be first played in public at MozFest. Through gameplay I hope to stimulate learning about the problems and opportunities concerning platform coops, their networking and how they can face the strong competition of privately owned networks – and maybe start thinking about possible solutions.\n\n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nI need tables (not just row of chairs) where the players can lay out their card decks and see other’s. \n \nMy session being a guided game play session, it could be repeated more than once during the festival without it being exactly the same thing :-)\n\n\n### Time needed\n90 mins\n",

To keep it this way, the technologies used to run the web should remain transparent and understandable.\r\n\r\nOpen Innovation is a space for challenging and learning about open source, open projects and growth on the web. We’ll investigate the challenges to open production (misinformation, draconian copyright) and the values of open creativity (working open techniques, tools and tactical transparency). The space is programmed as a highly-interactive platform for producing and protecting the principles of the open web. Join us in evolving our epically-open online world.\r\n",

We can demonstrate the VR build of his models through Oculus Rift and then encourage our participants to emulate him by constructing architecture from paper and other available materials as a means of contributing to a shared vision of the fallen city of Aleppo and how together we might rebuild it.\r\nWe will then capture their models using a simple process of photogrammetry, before exporting those 3D assets into Aframe for the participant to observe using their mobile devices.\r\n\r\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\r\nThe goal is to bridge the gap between the analogue world and the digital by illustrating how simple it is to build with physical materials, then capture those creations before transferring them into a WebVR world.\r\nDuring this process, participants will also learn of Mohammed Kteish and his goal to rebuild his city of Aleppo, which should provide a worthwhile context to the efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\r\nPapercraft Materials - Thick paper/ card\r\nglue\r\npaints\r\npens\r\nscissors etc.\r\n\r\nCamera\r\nLaptop\r\n\r\n\r\n### Time needed\r\nAll weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session\r\n",

This dystopian future is closer than you may think.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, what is the utopian version of the Internet in 2027? What future do we want to build? Where do emerging technologies like AI, mesh networking and Blockchain fit in? How do we ensure people are the most important part of the Internet?\r\n\r\nJoin us at Mozfest as we look into the future.

Web literacy isn’t just writing Python—it’s knowing how to wield a search engine, how to craft a strong password and when our online activities are being tracked. \r\n\r\nThrough hands-on workshops, participants will explore, make and play with the tools and technologies that form the fabric of the web. And through discussion and talks, we’ll invite our guests to reflect on, and improve, their relationship with the web. Our space will instill the skills and confidence in both young and old, students and teachers, to make the web a more vibrant, diverse ecosystem.\r\n",

Big tech corporations, select media companies and closed governments control the content on the Internet, the data that flows across the Internet and how people connect to the Internet. This dystopian future is closer than you may think.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, what is the utopian version of the Internet in 2027? What future do we want to build? Where do emerging technologies like AI, mesh networking and Blockchain fit in? How do we ensure people are the most important part of the Internet?\r\n\r\nJoin us at Mozfest as we look into the future.

He will then take people through installing and using Aletheia if attendees have laptops on them, and the session will end on a call to action on how people can support and contribute to Aletheia as part of the opensource community. \n\n### What is the goal or outcome of your session?\nPeople will have a better understanding of the flaws in scientific communication, will be introduced to some technical concepts that can be applied to address these problems, and will be left with clear pathways to contribution should they want to get involved themselves. \n\n\n### If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.\nWould be good to have a projector to show slides but presentation can be given without if need be.\n\n\n### Time needed\n60 mins\n",
